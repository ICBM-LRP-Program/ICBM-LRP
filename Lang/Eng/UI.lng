6662 LANG "Immediately after the devastation of WWII, the United States realizes that its monopoly on nuclear weapons puts it in a prime position to control the world's affairs. Feeling emboldened by their success and influence in the war, and also paranoid that something like it could happen again, drastic measures are taken to unite the entire world under American control and influence. Steer the United States through a tumultuous and brutal campaign of extreme violence and domination, by leveraging its massive forces and abusing its nuclear arsenal to achieve incredible military feats at an insurmountable human cost."

///MISSION OBJECTIVES + DESCRIPTIONS CONT. (don't translate this one)

6285 "Despite all the killing, and the horror and the violence, humanity couldn't take the final step and destroy itself for good.\n\nReflecting on the state of the world, and how nearly and how often it veered towards annihilation, a sort of clarity was realised.\n\nPeace conferences were arranged, diplomatic talks ensued, and eventually agreements were made.\nThe collective efforts and ethos of the human race were enough to dismantle the world's nuclear arsenals, reverse climate change, solve the energy crisis, restore the global ecology and secure a future worth living in."
6284 "You have successfully navigated the perilous geopolitical landscape for 97 years and ensured both the survival of the United States of America and the human race as a whole.\n\nThanks to your efforts and discretion, despite all that's happened, humankind will go on and prosper.\n\nYou survived nuclear annihilation by not letting it happen. With lasting peace finally on the horizon, your mission is complete. All that's left to do now is rest. Well done!"

6283 "Traditional nationalism cannot survive the fissioning of the atom. One world or none.\n\n           - Stuart Chase"

6282 "Ultimately, the casualties sustained in the face of nuclear fire were too great, and the United States of America has ceased to exist. Countless millions have been killed by the blasts and the flames, and countless more will succumb to the fallout. Famine, disease and anarchy will kill even more, and the living will envy the dead. All government functions are now suspended indefinitely. You are relieved of your command. Abandon hope, and Godspeed."

6281 "You did it. You've vanquished the Chinese and the Russians, crushing your enemies once and for all. Millions are dead, but you've done it. But, this won't be a long-lived victory. The global economy will just suffer more thanks to the destruction that's been sown, and though you've solved the problems that your enemies posed, there's still plenty that still haven't been fixed. What's worse, thanks to the hundreds of megatons that have been unleashed around the world, the nuclear fallout is starting to rain down. In the best case scenario, cancer rates spike and background radiation renders the Earth far less hospitable than it's ever been in human history. In the worst case scenario, nuclear winter sets in, and the entire world becomes a frozen, radioactive wasteland, and the human race goes extinct, along with the rest of life on Earth. Is this a victory? You've defeated the Russians and the Chinese, but lost everything else in the process."

6280 "Have China capitulate."
6279 "Have Russia capitulate."
6278 "Ensure at least 15% of the American population survives."
6277 "The demographic crisis in Russia has reached a peak and the country is weaker than ever before. In the United States and China, climate change has displaced millions along the coast, including those in major cities like New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Tensions between all three nations have spiked while they clamber for power and influence, as the global economy slumps again and the cost of living skyrockets from resource depletion, biodiversity loss and the ensuing famine and drought. With all the world's superpowers in a state of weakness and still resenting each other for conflicts past, paranoia is running deep, and suspicions are abound that it's only a matter of time before someone decides to strike first. Perhaps this is the end. After decades of sabre-rattling with thousands of nuclear weapons, maybe it was only a matter of time before they would finally be put to use. Maybe humankind's fate was sealed as soon as it split the atom. But maybe, maybe we can still make it through this."
6276 "2047. After decades of unmitigated crises, civilization in its current form has become untenable. Years of mutual distrust, meddling and hatred have pushed the US, China and Russia to their limits. Now, the human race is faced with its last major confrontation. History will change forever, as the world comes down to its last and final recourse."
6275 "Finale - Hell On Earth (Judgement Day, 2047)"

6274 "Mission Failed! We've been cut out of Africa!"
6273 "Mission Accomplished! We've maintained an influence!"
6272 "Have 'American Aligned Nations' control the entirety of Africa."
6271 "Have 'American Aligned Nations' control territories with at least 120 million people after 120 mins."
6270 "Do not take more than 1 million American civilian casualties."
6269 "Have 'American Aligned Nations' control territories with at least 80 million people after 120 mins."
6268 "Have 'American Aligned Nations' hold at least 1 African territory at all times."
6267 "The ever-increasing reliance on electronics and computers coupled with the shift away from fossil fuels to combat climate change has led to an endless demand for rare metals like coltan and lithium. Sub-Saharan Africa has become a hotbed for extracting these resources, which has grabbed the world's attention. On top of displacing locals and destroying gorilla habitats, this has led the world's major powers to sink their fingers into Africa and wage a series of proxy wars and political battles to secure access to the resources their nations need to get ahead. The demand has grown so high that foreign troops are openly being deployed to ‘provide stability' while civil unrest and ethnic conflict looms. Now, with a major economic crisis on the horizon, Africa is about to turn into a massive warzone, as Russian, Chinese, and Western-Aligned forces and their proxies erupt into battle to secure the minerals they need to prosper. It could have been so much simpler if people just recycled their cellphones and used their uranium for reactors instead of bombs..."
6266 "2035. The endless and ever-growing demand for rare-earth metals has led to the world's great powers to clamber over mineral rights across the African continent. As a war of influence and economics becomes increasingly volatile, bloodshed and destruction are erupting across Africa, leading to a thinly-veiled proxy war between the US, Russia and China, who are all competing to put their allies in control."
6265 "Mission 10 - Guerillas On The Line (2nd Great African War, 2035)"

6264 "Mission Failed! War rages across the Pacific!"
6263 "Mission Accomplished! China has withdrawn!"
6262 "Don't allow any nuclear weapons to damage friendly cities."
6261 "Keep friendly civilian casualties below 3,500,000."
6260 "Dissuade the Chinese invasion by sinking over 50 Chinese naval assets."
6259 "Force the DPRK to surrender by completely occupying it or destroying over 80% of its population."
6258 "Complete the mission within 45 minutes."
6257 "Intercept ballistic missiles and ensure less than 10 million friendly civilians die."
6256 "Destroy the Chinese surface and submarine fleets in the South China Sea."
6255 "Stop the Chinese from capturing any other allied territories."
6254 "Stop the North Koreans from fully occupying South Korea."
6253 "Keep Taiwan completely free of Chinese divisions for 10 minutes straight. Do NOT let Taiwan be captured."
6252 "Tensions have been rising in the old world. Russia's new ambitions have led to war and insecurity in the west, with NATO and the US watching restlessly as proxies fight to repel the Russian threat. Meanwhile in the Middle East, tensions are stewing again with another war in the Levant and a surge of instability, especially with the power-vacuum left by Iran. While the US and its European allies had their hands full, China was devising a plan to settle their territorial disputes once and for all. North Korean troops backed up with Chinese support and equipment have rushed over the DMZ in a bid to capture the South again, while China themselves are pushing an amphibious assault force to Taiwan and the South China Sea. Japan, Australia and much of ASEAN are scrambling to respond, but they won't be able to fend off the massive Chinese army without American support. The US will have to act quickly to decisively repel the Chinese and North Korean assaults before Beijing and Pyongyang become invested enough to escalate even further."
6251 "2022. With tensions rising around the world and the west preoccupied with conflicts closer to home in Europe and the Middle East, a long-stewing conflict erupts in the Far East. As China and North Korea seek to expand their influence and enforce their territorial claims through force and terror, the US must intervene and protect its allies from a long-dormant and ever-growing threat."

///MISSION 11 - Hell On Earth
6242 "Oh my god... I can't watch this...
"
6241 "Urgent message from Washington! We've been ordered to stand down immediately. There's going to be a conference tomorrow. I guess they've reached some sort of understanding? Either way, they're trying to work something out. The world gets to live another day. Thank god...
"
6240 "Well, we made it. Nikita Khrushchev once said that after a nuclear war, the living will envy the dead. I guess we'll find out if he's right.
...Commander? What did we just do?
"
6239 "We just lost contact with... Everyone. I guess... this is it? It's over.
"
6238 "So, this is how it's going to be...
"
6237 "So, it's come to this. Our nuclear forces are at maximum readiness and waiting for your orders. One way or another, this is where it ends. It's been an honour, Commander.
"

///MISSION 10 - Guerillas On The Line
6236 "We have installed Pro-Western governments in every country in Sub-Saharan Africa. We have a strong influence over the entire continent now, and perhaps more importantly, Russia and China don't. Extremely impressive work, Commander!
"
6235 "What did you do that for?! This was just supposed to be a proxy war, now there's nukes coming at us! Oh my god...
"
6234 "The Chinese are getting frustrated. They're preparing a massive group of reinforcements to help secure their position. You're going to have a fight on your hands soon!
"
6233 "Russia is on the ropes. Intel reports they're sending a huge wave of reinforcements to back up whatever they have left. Expect some hard fighting!
"
6232 "Russia doesn't have any more footholds in Africa and they're pulling out completely. Good work!
"
6231 "We've completely pushed China out of Africa. Beijing is calling it quits and pursuing other avenues. Well done!
"
6230 "The Chinese and the Russians are both using tactical nuclear weapons now! Be careful! This is going to get really bad, really fast!
"
6229 "Russia and China have both authorized the use of nerve agents in Africa. They're not messing around anymore...
"
6228 "The facade's over, Russia and China are now openly hostile to each other. Not necessarily a bad thing for us, but stay on your toes.
"
6227 "Russian and Chinese forces are openly targeting unfriendly governments in the name of 'stability' or whatever other excuses they can come up with. It's obviously a facade, but we need to do the same thing and establish pro-western, pro-democratic governments for the same reason. If the Chinese or the Russians get too powerful, that's bad news for global stability, and we need those resources too. We have 3 carrier groups surrounding the continent and some forces on the ground already. There's also reinforcements in the US that are at your disposal. Highly populated territories take priority! Good luck!
"

///MISSION 9 - Dragon Slayer
6226 "Well, we definitely made our point! Beijing is ordering a complete withdrawal and is asking for negotiations. We can firmly call this one a victory. Excellent job, Commander!
"
6225 "We pushed them too far! China is launching a massive nuclear attack on American soil! Brace for impact!
"
6224 "Beijing is livid! They've publicly announced that they're going to escalate, and Langley is convinced that means tactical nukes. This is going to get messy, be careful!
"
6223 "We've got North Korea's attention now! Intel suggests that their nuclear forces are at maximum readiness and are preparing for an ICBM launch. We have to be prepared!
"
6222 "This is getting intense, the enemy has authorized chemical weapons. There's also reports that China is rushing its prototype hypersonic weapons into service and preparing to invade Vietnam. I wonder if they know what they're getting into...
"
6221 "Intel reports that the PLA is mobilizing mechanized, marine and airborne divisions to Korea and Taiwan. They're also preparing their 5th generation fighter squadrons. Get ready for a fight!
"
6220 "Washington is getting a little concerned about the death toll we're seeing. We can recover from this, but it's something to keep in mind.
"
6219 "The PLAN is getting rattled over how many of their ships we've turned into artificial reefs. I think Beijing understands that their naval war is a losing fight now. Good work!
"
6218 "We've captured North Korea and cornered the government, and this time, they're not getting off easily. Juche is banned, the KPA is unravelling and Korea is going to be reunified by the end of the year. We should have done this 70 years ago... Well, better late than never!
"
6217 "Well, that was a little heavy-handed, but I guess they kind of had it coming... We've completely destroyed North Korea's industry and the entire country is in anarchy now. Needless to say, they're not a threat anymore.
"
6216 "This war has been dragging on for too long. China is doubling down and we're losing support back home. This is going to go on for years now at this rate...
"
6215 "There's been too many civilian casualties! We need to reevaluate our strategy, we can't carry on like this!
"
6214 "We've sunk the PLAN's contingent in the South China Sea. Now if they want to resolve this dispute, they can't do it by throwing their weight around. Well done!
"
6213 "China's overtaken Vietnam and now they're trying to use it as a bargaining chip. Negotiations are underway but as far as Washington is concerned, we just lost.
"
6212 "South Korea has fallen! What a disaster... Two wars, and for this?
"
6211 "The Chinese have captured Taiwan! We couldn't keep them out!
"
6210 "Why North Korea is even allowed to exist after the thrashing we gave them is beyond me. If the Soviets didn't throw a tantrum in the UN, we could have avoided this whole mess. Well, this time we won't be so nice. North Korea is preparing to launch ballistic missiles at South Korea and Japan. We have a limited ABM contingent deployed but it won't be enough if they ramp up their attacks. Naval groups in Guam and the Pacific are on standby to support. Don't forget about Taiwan! We need to crush this campaign before it starts!
"

///MISSION 8 - Spring Cleaning
///
6209 "Israel is running out of manpower, they've publicly announced that they're willing to 'resort to drastic measures' if they get overrun. We need to act fast, especially if Da'ish gets their hands on Israel's weapon stockpile! The last thing we need is more nuclear bomb trucks!
"
6208 "We've got urgent news! I don't know how, but Da'ish somehow managed to restart Iraq's chemical weapons program. They now have access to weaponized Sarin! Be on alert, and make sure they can't use it in range of any cities!
"
6207 "Da'ish and Iran are both out of action. I wouldn't count on peace in the Middle East, but at least the situation is manageable now. Outstanding job, Commander!
"
6206 "We've defeated the Iranians and are in a position to force a regime change. Democracy is back on the agenda. Incredible work!
"
6205 "Well done, Commander. There's always going to be a few radicals running around like cockroaches, but we've crushed their ability to pose a serious threat to any genuine governments.
"
6204 "Selling this as a peace keeping mission is going to be difficult now that there's nukes involved... We should still be alright as long as we can complete our objectives without too many casualties.
"
6203 "Civilian casualties are getting high. We can still salvage this mission easily enough, but try to avoid collateral damage and keep the terrorists away from the cities if you can!
"
6202 "This operation has dragged on for too long, public support is dropping and Washington wants to pull out.
"
6201 "There's been too many civilian casualties! As far as Washington is concerned, this operation is a failure. So much for stabilizing the region.
"
6200 "Intel reports that Iran's nuclear program has produced functional weapons! Don't panic, we just need to make sure we can stop them before they do too much damage!
"
6199 "All of Iran's nuclear sites have been eliminated. We can all sleep a little better now. Good work.
"
6198 "Da'ish is out of control! They've taken too much ground!
"
6197 "We've killed or captured most of the key commanders of Da'ish. They'll have a hard time coming back from that. Well done.
"
6196 "Maybe we should have done a better job of rebuilding Iraq. At least the Middle East finally agrees on something: We need to kill ISIS. Or ISIL. Or Da'ish. Can't even agree on a name... Regardless, we need to hunt down their leadership and keep them contained. We also have reason to believe Iran is starting a nuclear weapons program, for real this time. We need to destroy their facilities before they can do anything drastic. On that note, keep an eye on Israel. They won't admit they have nukes, but if things get too hot they might uh, overreact. Good luck.
"


///MISSION 7 - Ground Zero
6195 "We've killed and captured over 20 people involved in the nuclear deliveries to Al Qaeda. The FBI is going to take over from here, but we've done our part. I can't even imagine how many lives we just saved...
"
6194 "We've verified the death of the mastermind in charge of the attacks. There's a lot of documents here, he must have been planning this for years... Well, he's not going to do it again, we made sure of that.
"
6193 "The man responsible for recruiting, training and coordinating the teams involved in the attacks is confirmed KIA. Good work.
"
6192 "We just took out the Al Qaeda leader responsible for smuggling the weapons into the US and sourcing the trucks. Now that we know how it happened, we can make sure they can never do it again.
"
6191 "Ladies and gentlemen, we got 'em! We just killed the head of Al Qaeda and some of his top lieutenants. Serves him right. Let's just hope he gets replaced by somebody dumber. Or nobody at all...
"
6190 "We've seized control of Afghanistan from the Taliban. That's a major blow to Al Qaeda. It's been a warzone for over 20 years, maybe now it can finally find some peace.
"
6189 "There's no more leads from the CIA or FBI. That's every target eliminated or captured, and in record time. There's no way to fix what happened, but at least we stopped them in the end. Outstanding work, Commander.
"
6188 "With that, we've taken out all the major overseas Al Qaeda cells we could link to the attack. Great work!
"
6187 "We didn't hit them fast enough. Al Qaeda's probably licking their wounds and regrouping already. It's just a matter of time before they try again now...
"
6186 "Based on the intel we have, that should be the last of the bomb trucks. We're safe for now, but we need to deal with the problem overseas. Some countries are okay with us moving troops through them but don't want to be involved beyond that. I would recommend landing our troops in 'neutral' territory and then proceeding over land. Just don't wander into territory where we're not wanted! We don't want to start another war on top of this!
"
6185 "It seems like some of the countries overseas have gotten wind that our operators have been over there... We'll have plausible deniability as long as we only send covert units, but we can expect an increased security presence now.
"
6184 "No! A second bomb has hit an American city! I can't even believe this... How could this happen?! This is a nightmare!
"
6183 "We've just received a diplomatic complaint that we've committed an act of war. Countries across the entire region are getting angry about American influence. We can't afford to get pulled into another war, we need to call this off now!
"
6182 "There's been too many civilian casualties, this is just going to rile up the locals and make everything even worse. We came here to hunt terrorists but it looks like we're just making more of them. Time to pull out and reevaluate our strategy.
"
6181 "We've secured Iraq and are ready to dismantle the regime. UNMOVIC searched all over the country but there's no signs of any WMDs. What a waste of time... The CIA just gave us intel that the weapons and the nuclear material were actually stolen from the USSR during the dissolution, and they've linked the suppliers to a smuggling ring in Tajikistan. I bet they knew more than they're letting on... Either way, we need those smugglers taken out so we can investigate this further. Let's get some operators over to Tajikistan!
"
6180 "Oh my god. The FBI got a tip on this, it's just... Who would believe it? No time to waste, the FBI took out one of the cells before the attack, but there's more bombs out there! Get the nation on lockdown and find them, put up checkpoints and scramble search parties! After that, the British are going to help us pay Iraq and Afghanistan a visit. The president is convinced that they're the source of the attack. I hope he's right... The USS John C Stennis is en route in the Indian Ocean. They're gonna pay for this.
"

///MISSION 6 - Perestroika
6173 "The coup is starting to run out of support, and it looks like the loyalists are quickly taking back control. We've done our part, now it's time to let this play out on its own. This might finally be the end of the Cold War!
"
6172 "We're out of time! The Ultranationalists have the launch codes! We're going to DEFCON 1, this is it!
"
6171 "You've used too many nukes! The entire Soviet Union is furious at the west and in full revolt against the loyalists!
"
6170 "Be careful using nuclear weapons, Commander! It just makes the hardliners angrier and gives them even more support!
"
6169 "There's been a lot of civilian casualties... I think a quick victory and a lasting peace are a pipe dream now. This doesn't bode well for global security...
"
6168 "Great work! That's half of the VIPs. The hardliners are catching on now, so expect more resistance on the ground. They're actively hunting our operators now, so bring extra firepower!
"
6167 "We've freed the separatists again. The ultranationalists are probably going to change their priorities now. Be careful.
"
6166 "All the separatists have been put down and now the hardliners are threatening Poland and vice versa. This is getting too high-risk. The president is ordering us to pull out while he weighs his options.
"
6165 "What are you doing? You just nuked a city! The entire Soviet bloc is screaming bloody murder at the US now! So much for peace, there's no way this is going to end well!
"
6164 "We just lost some top-ranking VIPs! The loyalists aren't going to be able to succeed without them!
"
6163 "We've recovered all of the top-level officials. Excellent work! If we can get the rest of the lower-level ones, the loyalists will be in a stronger position.
"
6162 "VIPs are secure and in friendly territory.
"
6161 "Special forces have VIPs secured and in tow. Requesting orders for extraction. We have to carry the VIPs to NATO or US territory and drop them there to ensure their safety.
"
6160 "The USSR is a meatgrinder right now! We need to slip our special forces through the fighting and rescue the loyalist leaders, and stop the rebellion from taking too much ground. The Soviets don't want European NATO involved after last time, and they're still rebuilding everything anyway, but we can still deploy troops from there. Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary are also offering us safe passage. Subs and carriers with SEAL teams are on standby in the North Atlantic and Pacific.
Move our Spec-Ops Teams to the VIPs, pick them up and carry them back to friendly territory. Keep it tight, there's not much room for collateral damage! If we butcher this, it's another cold war, or worse!
" 

///MISSION 5 - Able Archer
6151 "The Soviets are in Istanbul! Back up the Turks! If the reds manage to overtake the country, then taking it back is going to be a nightmare!
"
6150 "We're seeing field reports saying that Soviet forces are now deploying nerve gas, and France and the UK have broken out their mustard gas stores in response. Expect heavy casualties. I hope our MOPP gear is up to par...
"
6149 "NORAD is reporting an enormous inbound nuclear attack! it's too late to stop it and the Kremlin isn't answering! I think this is it!
"
6148 "That's it! We've pushed the Iron Curtain all the way back to the Motherland. The Kremlin is demanding a ceasefire and threatening to use nukes. It's over. As far as I'm concerned, we just won World War III. Incredible work, Commander!
"
6147 "We've got Soviet Marines landing in Scotland! The Brits are threatening to flatten Moscow if they keep pushing! Get the reds out of the UK before we have a full-blown nuclear war on our hands!
"
6146 "We're intercepting chatter from the Soviets. They're getting mad now! Expect more resistance, and keep an eye on the sea. There's a lot of material being diverted to Severodvinsk, which is the naval base near Arkhangelsk. They're up to something!
"
6145 "VDV paratroopers have made an airborne landing in Iceland! We have to push them out!
"
6144 "Satellite imagery shows increased Soviet army activity and SIGINT indicates a major offensive is under way. Get ready, because they're coming.
"
6143 "There's been a lot of nukes in play. If it keeps up, this could easily turn into a full-blown nuclear exchange! We either need to find a way to stop the nukes, or finish this war before it's too late!
"
6142 "The Soviets are now authorizing tactical counterforce strikes with nuclear weapons! Be on your toes, this could get really bad really fast!
"
6141 "We've established stable supply lines, you can now deploy forces directly to Europe. Look alive, it's time to put the pressure on!
"
6140 "NATO forces in Europe are trying to keep the invasion back and we have a few American units on the ground already, but we need to mobilize reinforcements immediately! Once we establish supply lines, we can deploy reinforcements directly to Europe, but until then, it's up to you to move our troops overseas and hold the line! Be careful, the Soviets are already out for blood. If you use nukes or chemical weapons, they'll definitely return the favour!
"

///MISSION 4 - Condor
6137 "Well, that looks pretty conclusive to me! All the juntas have been ousted, the communists are going back into hiding, and the Soviets are pulling back. Now the CIA can clean up the mess they made and democracy in South America can get a fresh start. You've turned this embarrassment into a decisive victory. Outstanding work, Commander!
"
6136 "There's been too many civilian casualties! Washington has decided it's not worth it anymore. This whole fiasco has ruined our reputation and there's no point in liberating South America if there's nothing left of it. Why couldn't the CIA just keep their noses clean...
"
6135 "The Soviets are ferrying troops to Brazil from Lithuania, and we can seriously hurt their invasion if we interdict them. We also need our own foothold in South America, so we should mobilize our troops at home and capture a territory right away. The Enterprise is en route to the Chilean coast now. Don't forget, we have to destroy the 5 intelligence centers quickly before the Soviets can prove we were involved in Condor. Good luck!
"
6134 "Good work sinking those landing ships! We're seeing a lot of activity at the submarine base in Gremikha. I think that got their attention.
"
6133 "The Soviets have just authorized the use of tactical nuclear weapons. Things are about to get serious, keep the situation under control!
"
6132 "Soviet forces and their proxies have just received authorization to attack American forces on sight. There's no point in pretending anymore, it's us against them.
"
6131 "Communist forces managed to find and raid an Operation Condor blacksite. They disseminated everything they found to the KGB and have proven the CIA was involved. Now they're using that to rile up the populace against us. Expect some extra resistance, and an angry phone call from Langley.
"
6130 "Good work, we've destroyed all evidence of our involvement. The Soviets can accuse us all they want, but they can't prove anything.
"


///MISSION 3 - Vietnam
6127 "Incredible work Commander! I guess we won't have to worry too much about communist influence in Southeast Asia now. Well done!
"
6126 "PAVN troops are mustering in the north for a sustained offensive. Laos, Cambodia and Burma are considered hostile but aren't officially involved yet. Try and keep the conflict confined to Vietnam until you have the advantage, otherwise things could get ugly. USS America is at Yankee Station to provide support and we have attack helicopters stationed at several bases, but there's a strong SAM presence on the ground. Good luck!
"
6125 "Commander, we've lost contact with the Thai government and the royal family. Support for the war is about to collapse, I think we just lost.
"
6124 "This is MACV Headquarters! Saigon is overrun, we cannot hold this position! Taking heavy casualties, requesting immediate evac!
"
6123 "Careful, Commander. We may have more freedom to use nuclear weapons than usual, but if it gets out of control the Soviets will launch a mass attack. They've already issued a formal warning. Vietnam isn't worth a nuclear winter!
"
6122 "The USSR just publicly announced that they will 'crush the imperialist invaders'. That's us, in case you forgot.
Soviet reinforcements are coming, and they have orders to attack American units on sight.
"
6121 "Several MACV-SOG patrols have reported communist preparations to invade Thailand. Keep them out!
"
6120 "Be advised, intel reports Cambodian and Laotian units are now mobilizing to attack American forces. The Soviets have also dispatched a fleet en route to Vietnam. It may be carrying tactical nuclear weapons, keep an eye on it.
"

///MISSION 2 - Cuba
6116 "We have intel indicating that a Soviet attack is imminent. We need to wrap this up fast!
"
6115 "I think you made your point... Publicly, the Soviets are wildly protesting the attacks on Cuba and swearing revenge, but in reality, they know it's a lost cause and they want to de-escalate. Cuba, on the other hand, isn't in a position to threaten anyone right now. Well, in our defence, we tried being diplomatic first...
"
6114 "The Cubans are surrendering and the Soviets have called a meeting to discuss terms. It looks like we're getting our initial deal after all. Well done, Commander!
"
6113 "Aerial reconnaissance indicates a multitude of advanced Soviet-made anti-ship and anti-air defences. We have a short window to destroy the launch sites and bomber bases before the Soviets can reinforce them. Nuclear weapons are authorized, but be careful of how the Soviets will react. Good luck.
"
6112 "We've intercepted communications from Moscow. Soviet submarines in the caribbean are now authorized to engage American naval assets. Be advised, we believe they may have nuclear torpedoes.
"
6111 "Well, we've got their attention now! The Soviets have dispatched a naval convoy, en route to Cuba. We have to defeat the Cubans before it arrives! If you attack the convoy, there's a good chance the Soviets will retaliate with nuclear weapons. Watch your fire!
"
6110 "Be careful, Commander! We might have the diplomatic high ground, but the Soviets are making threats after that nuclear attack, and they might do something drastic!
"

///MISSION 1 - Korea
6105 "North Korean forces are attacking Seoul! We're outnumbered, you'll have to send reinforcements from Japan! We have 2 landing ships in the area and can send planes from Itazuke. Two carrier groups have been rerouted from the South China Sea. Hold Busan at all costs!
"
6104 "Be careful Commander, now that nuclear weapons are on the table, the Soviets might return the favour!
"
6103 "Great work Commander! We've pushed the communists out of Korea! Don't celebrate yet though. The Chinese are planning to counterattack, and there could be a Soviet response.
"
6102 "We've made it to a Chinese city. China's getting scared and Moscow's getting angry. The Soviets are mobilizing reinforcements, get ready for a fight!
"
6101 "Outstanding! There's no way Beijing and Moscow are going to let this keep going now. This war is as good as finished!
"
6100 "It seems like you've struck a nerve with the Chinese. Intel reports several Chinese divisions mobilizing to Korea as we speak! Get ready, there's a lot of them!
"

6096 "Mission Failed! The Middle East is in chaos!"

6087 "Prevent Da'ish from controlling more than 7 territories."
6086 "Find and destroy the covert Da'ish leadership cells."
6085 "In 2011, the Arab Spring made waves across the Middle East and North Africa, with the people demanding democratic reforms and an end to the old despotic regimes. Foreign interference and agitators have exacerbated the crisis, and civil war has broken out first in Syria, and then across the Arab world. In the ensuing chaos, radical islamist groups have seized massive swathes of land and committed countless atrocities, leading to an ongoing international intervention. Da'ish, (AKA The Islamic State) has been emboldened by an unidentified benefactor wishing to destabilize the region and now controls a massive quasi-state that threatens the Middle East. Meanwhile, Iran, neighbouring a historically hostile Iraq which is now rapidly being overtaken by Da'ish, has been revitalising its WMD program in anticipation of deterring an imminent invasion. Now it's up to the United States and coalition forces to contain the Da'ish expansion, while also stifling Iran's nuclear ambitions in a complicated 3 front war."
6084 "2015. After years of unrest and turmoil, the situation in the Middle East has given rise to a dangerous non-state actor that threatens the stability of the region, and threatens to wreak havoc if left unchecked. As Iran pursues nuclearization to strengthen its position, America and its allies must intervene to stabilize the situation and defuse the emerging threats before they become uncontrollable."

6072 "Do NOT provoke a war with any countries not declared hostile."
6071 "Invade and capture Afghanistan."
6070 "Invade and capture Iraq."
6069 "Find and destroy all bomb trucks on American soil before any more of them can detonate."
6068 "The widespread proliferation of nuclear weapons and the abrupt and tumultuous dissolution of the USSR has made it possible for radical groups to construct or obtain crude or stolen nuclear devices. While preparing to conduct a coordinated attack across America, a nuclear-armed Al Qaeda terror cell was successfully apprehended in Washington, but another in New York was already lying in wait. The atomic bombing of New York killed tens of thousands of innocents and brought the world to a standstill. Those responsible must be stopped, but the looming threat of additional attacks still looms. Intelligence indicates that there could be as many as 8 other similar weapons scattered across the US, waiting for an opportune moment to attack. All the bomb vehicles must be intercepted before they can detonate, while a manhunt across Central Asia and the Middle East will have to take place to hunt down and kill or capture those responsible, and an invasion of Iraq seeks to destroy the alleged source of the weapons."
6067 "2001. As the world's first nuclear terrorist attack rocks America to the core and shocks the entire world, the US military and its national security apparatus must scramble across the country to defuse the looming threat posed by additional attacks. Concurrently, a manhunt and an invasion in the Middle East and Central Asia are initiated to confront those responsible."

6057 "Rescue the major loyalist officials in Moscow, St Petersburg, Kiev and the Yamantau Complex."
6056 "Do NOT let the loyalists lose all their territory."
6055 "Liberate Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Georgia. Do NOT let the Ultranationalists capture all of them."
6054 "The situation in the Soviet Union is complex. Relations are finally thawing with the West and revolutions in 1989 have signalled the beginning of the end of the USSR, as demands for political and social change challenge the status quo posed by the Soviet State. Estonia, Georgia, Latvia and Lithuania have already broken away from the USSR, and it appears that a total dissolution of the Soviet Union is possible. However, a powerful group of Soviet hardliners and their supporters, many embittered and impassioned by the Able Archer War, have begun a coup to overthrow the current Soviet government and stop the reforms that are dissolving the union. As a violent rift between ultranationalist and loyalist forces erupts across the USSR and plunges the nation into chaos, the US and NATO have a short window of time to rescue the legitimate government and stabilise the situation before the ultranationalist rebellion seizes control of the WMD stockpile and forces authorization to use nuclear weapons."
6053 "1991. With communism in the rest of Europe on the verge of collapse, a deeply polarized Soviet Union suddenly finds itself engulfed in a brutal civil war, after a coup attempt leads to a massive power struggle between government loyalists and ultranationalist hardliners. With thousands of nuclear weapons on the line and global stability at stake, the US must intervene before it's too late."

6048 "Capture and hold Poland."
6047 "Capture and hold East Germany."
6046 "Do NOT let the US or NATO take more than 5 million civilian casualties."
6045 "Recapture and hold all NATO Countries when the timer runs out after 60 minutes."
6044 "In preparation for a potential Soviet attack leading up to a nuclear war, the Able Archer training exercise is held across NATO to increase wartime readiness and improve interoperability, and Able Archer '83 introduced new elements to make it more immersive and realistic. This had the unfortunate consequence of convincing the Warsaw Pact that NATO was planning a surprise attack, leading them to preemptively invade West Germany with their nuclear forces on high alert. While NATO's European members hold back the onslaught, Canadian and American reinforcements must rush overseas to the front lines, while the US also weighs its options on how hard and how far it can push the Soviets back while a diplomatic solution is worked out, all without escalating beyond the point of no return."
6043 "1984. Spooked by a series of near-misses with the United States and a seemingly overt prelude to a nuclear war, the USSR and Warsaw Pact launch a surprise attack on NATO, believing that their enemy was preparing to do the same to them. The nightmarish confrontation everyone feared comes to life, as war erupts across Europe and steers it towards nuclear armageddon."

6035 "Prevent the Soviet Union from annexing more than 8 South American territories at any time."
6034 "Control at least 8 South American territories after 120 minutes."
6033 "In the 1970s, Operation Condor was conducted by dictatorships across South America as a means to repress political opponents and dissidents by any means necessary. For better or worse, the US stuck its fingers in it and got its hands dirty in order to keep communism in check. However, KGB spies have uncovered and exposed the operation and brought the issue to the UN. Now, the entire world knows what's happening, and the Soviets and their allies have seized on the opportunity to launch an invasion of the continent and fund socialist guerillas to overthrow their oppressors and inevitably establish new pro-Soviet governments. Now, the US, trying to save face and stop a communist takeover, must launch its own intervention against the ruling juntas and stop the communists before a second iron curtain forms over South America. Preferably while also covering up the role they played in starting this mess in the first place..."
6032 "1976. After uncovering secret government oppression in South America, the Soviet Union has taken it upon itself to invade and overthrow the ruling juntas, and establish new Marxist governments in their place. Now the US has to scramble into action to stop a communist takeover, while also saving face and covering up the role they played in making this happen in the first place."

6023 "Do NOT let the communists reach Saigon."
6022 "The Vietnam War has been dragging on for years now and the Soviet Union has decided it's time to finally confront the United States and strengthen their influence in Asia, as the Sino-Soviet split turns China from an ally to a competitor. The USSR has supported communist forces all over Southeast Asia, leading to regime takeovers in Laos, Cambodia and Burma. Soviet influence dominates the entire region except for a pocket of South Vietnam, as well as nominally neutral Thailand. Faced with overt Soviet opposition and a new, unified hostile communist coalition, America is forced to quickly double-down and assert its position before public support disappears, and before the communists seize their opportunity in Bangkok."
6021 "1968. American forces have become jaded after fighting over Vietnam for years now, and the communist north is starting to gain some serious momentum. But now, with the additional threat posed by a Soviet-backed communist coalition threatening the region, America must use its renewed anti-communist vigor to fully commit and win in Vietnam once and for all."

6012 "Tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union are rising. In response to the US stationing nuclear weapons in NATO member states like Turkiye, the USSR has agreed to station ballistic missiles in Cuba to safeguard the communist government from American interference. The threat of a nuclear-armed Soviet ally, right in America's backyard, threatens the global balance of power. After diplomatic talks, the US has agreed to withdraw its weapons from Turkiye, but the Soviets have cited the threat from nuclear-armed Britain and France as reason to deliver their weapons to Cuba anyway. Holding the diplomatic high-ground,  the US now has a short window to neutralise the Cuban threat without the Soviets escalating to a nuclear attack, one way or another..."
6011 "1962. The US and USSR find themselves in a tense diplomatic standoff over the positioning of their nuclear weapons. When the US concedes and pulls its missiles away from the Iron Curtain, the Soviets are unmoved and attempt to nuclearize their Cuban allies. With the threat of a nuclear-armed communist country only 90 miles from American soil, the United States is forced to take extreme measures."

There's 3 ways for a war like this to end: Either the pollution meter reaches 100% and the world falls into nuclear winter, the fallout countdown starts and finishes and a global ceasefire is declared, or every faction is destroyed and surrenders except for one. Every nuclear blast raises the pollution meter and brings the world closer to oblivion. Make your time count!
You're in charge now. Destroy as much of the enemy population as possible, and try and save our own if you can! You can exclude units from strike plans using the icons near their names in the unit menu if you need to intervene. Now would be a good time to do that!"
4542 LANG "Oh. Of course..."
4541 LANG "No turning back now..."

For this plan, we're going to assign all of our WMD delivery systems to attack cities. Attackers are on the left, targets are on the right.
For attackers, select SSBNs, ICBM Silos, Regular and Specialized Airbases, and aircraft carriers. Add armies as well, they can massacre civilians if they're in an enemy city. Might as well let them join in...
For targets, select cities, and nothing more."

So, we'll add another element to this plan. Click the 'plus' sign on the left underneath the first part of the plan."
4518 LANG "Similarly to the attacker menu, you can select which targets you want to attack based on their location. This can be useful if you want to attack a specific region in preparation for an invasion, among other things. We'll be attacking every enemy OHR, so keeping it set to Any Region should be fine."
4517 LANG "Now that we have an attacker set, select Over-Horizon Radars as a target in the menu at the top. You can click it multiple times to set a priority. These are a key target, so make sure they're kept at Priority 1."
4516 LANG "You'll note the 3 tables in the center - these denote which units will be involved in the attack based on their current location. On the left table, you can specify that only units in certain regions should attack. On the right table, you can specify any unit groups that you've created, like in the first tutorial. 
The middle table is to specify units within specific coordinates that you can set. If you click 'Add Points', you can click and drag on the map to draw circles, and anything encompassed in a circle will be included in the attack.
You can play around with it, but make sure that all of our Spec-Ops Teams are included in the plan. The easiest way to do that is to simply remove any specific selections and click 'Any Region'. When you're ready, press Edit Targets."
4515 LANG "Now, click the Spec-Ops Team at the top to designate Spec-Ops Teams as attackers."
4514 LANG "In the top left above the red 'ATTACK' triangle, click the Edit Attackers button."
4513 LANG "In Phase 3, we'll drop high-yield gravity bombs on all of their largest cities, and hit the smaller ones with heavy ICBMs, SSBNs, carrier-based bombers, and every other nuke that we have left. We're going to lay waste to everything they have. Now, let's make our first plan."
4512 LANG "In Phase 2, we'll send in armies to draw their attention and keep them busy, use our carrier groups to finish off their missile defense systems and use electronic warfare aircraft and cruise missiles to take out their SAMs.
If we missed any launchers in the initial strike, we'll destroy them using our planes and SSBNs, which can destroy them quickly. Then, that should leave them wide-open for the final phase."
4511 LANG "First, we're going to destroy the enemy's over-horizon radar network, so they can't detect incoming ballistic missiles. That should make it easier to take them by surprise and greatly decrease their missile defence capability. We have spec-ops teams on standby to destroy them.
Then, we'll detonate EMPs over enemy territory to stun their other radars and drastically affect the GDP output from their cities. At the same time, we should destroy their ICBM launchers so they can't retaliate. We'll use ICBMs for that."
4510 LANG "From the advanced planner, you can direct specific units to attack specific regions and coordinate land-based invasions. You can accomplish a lot with it with a bit of creativity... At first it looks complicated, but it's similar to the basic planner. We'll start working on a strike plan in a moment, but let's quickly review what our plan is."
4509 LANG "The basic strike planner is perfect for quickly organizing broad attacks, but if you want to organize an attack with more nuance, it's better to use the Advanced Planner. Click 'Advanced' to open it."
4508 LANG "Once you create a plan, you can execute it at any time and all the associated units will attack their targets. Useful for cutting down on micromanagement, or in the event of an emergency..."
4507 LANG "Suicide Mission means that aircraft will fly beyond their return range to attack targets.
Synchronize Attack means the units will wait and attack all at the same time.
Timed Destruction means the units will fire in such a way that all of the warheads will reach their targets at the same time.
Auto Continue means the attackers will keep attacking different targets instead of just attacking once and stopping.
Auto Build warheads means any used weapons will have replacements made in the construction queue.
Select Best Config means each unit will automatically change weapons based on which target they're attacking, with heavy weapons being used against cities and lighter weapons being used against units."
4506 LANG "Welcome to the War Room. From here, you can create War Plans that automatically issue coordinated orders to your units based on what you want them to accomplish. Right now, you can see the basic strike planner. Let's go over it quickly.
On the left, you can see a list of attacking units. On the right, you can see a list of targets. The way the strike planner works is simple: To make a strike plan, select your attackers, select what to attack, select what factions will be attacked, and then specify any specific options you want at the bottom."
4505 LANG "Since we don't have any defensive capabilities but have access to some incredible firepower, our strategy is going to revolve around quickly destroying the enemy's defences, eliminating their ability to use WMDs, and then destroying their cities. We'll be using the War Room to coordinate our attacks. Let's go there now.
Exit the research menu, and then click the 'Plus Icon' in the bottom left corner to open the War Room and create a new War Plan."
4504 LANG "I won't bore you with the details, so you can go through each tab and see what capabilities we have on your own. It's worth noting, we have some very sophisticated offensive systems, but no missile defences. We put all of our money on deterrence and mutually assured destruction.
When you plan your strategy, you'll have to prioritize what you really need and make some compromises. This is especially important because there's no telling when the enemy might attack, so you can't waste time getting capabilities that aren't useful to your strategy.
But, this is just an exercise, so we're going in well-equipped. When you're ready, I'll brief you on how we're going to run this operation."
4503 LANG "You can see we've invested heavily into our ballistic missile capabilities, and we have access to the most advanced MIRVs on offer, as well as submarine and air-launched ballistic missiles. In other words, we have the makings of a full nuclear triad, and we're going to use it to full effect."
4502 LANG "Let's look at the Weapons of Mass Destruction tab. You can see we have Advanced Multistage Weapons, Super EMP weapons and Improved Chemical weapons. 
Advanced Multistage Weapons is our main nuclear technology and what gives our nukes their punch. We also need that level of tech to build advanced MIRVs.
Super EMPs allow us to easily cripple the enemy's economy and limit their ability to retaliate once we launch our full-scale attack.
The chemical weapons are there to give our armies a bit of an edge against enemy armies. Armies aren't central to our strategy, but they're basically a necessity for self-defence, and we'll be putting them to work in this operation.
Now, go to the ballistic missile tab."
4501 LANG "First, let's review the strategy that we've devised to make this happen. There's plenty of ways to crush the opposition, but you'll have to carefully decide which way is going to work the best, and build up your capabilities over time to make it happen. Of course, we're going to skip to the good part, so let's just talk about what capabilities we have. Open the research menu."
4500 LANG "Welcome back, Commander. This is the final training exercise. After this, you should know everything that's essential for the performance of your duties. Then it's just a matter of practice and trial and error. We're going to be conducting a massive coordinated attack against our enemies, using a combination of conventional forces and weapons of mass destruction, in order to completely destroy them and their capacity to fight. "

///TUTORIAL 10 - Covert Action
4423 LANG "Well, congratulations, Commander. That covers every major topic that you need to know about to be successful in your role. The only thing left to do now is put it all together and learn how to orchestrate a mass attack. You can return to the main menu, or start the last training exercise and learn how to destroy the world."
4422 LANG "...Which is why it's important that YOU know what you're doing. It would be really embarrassing if we lost a major city because you just let some guy in a semi-truck drive a nuclear bomb straight into town. Never underestimate how much you can accomplish with covert action, and don't underestimate how much the enemy can do to YOU if you're not prepared for it!"
4421 LANG "Well done. We just destroyed a major city and they probably have no idea what hit them. Bomb trucks can be extremely dangerous, but they're slow, vulnerable and difficult to get into place and deploy effectively against an enemy that knows what they're doing. They're best used as a desperation weapon or against enemies who have their guard down. Other delivery methods like bombers or missiles are far more efficient, but sometimes you can hit them when they don't expect it. You can do a lot of damage if you can take an enemy by surprise or if they don't know what they're doing..."
4420 LANG "Now load a 25MT bomb onto it and order it to destroy Manaus. We already have the bomb stockpiled. Be careful not to drive too close to the army base, or they'll see the truck and shoot at it!"
4419 LANG "Perfect. Now it's time to do something awful. We've weakened the enemy's defences and put ourselves in a great position to attack. We could easily send out bombers to flatten their cities. But we're going to do something else.
Build a heavy bomb truck and deploy it near the border."
4418 LANG "Great. Now, let's use covert units to their full potential. First, destroy that security checkpoint we found earlier. Hit it with an airstrike from our small airbase. You can use an attack helicopter or a jet. Either one will work, but remember that they have anti-air weapons."
4417 LANG "Wow, look at that. More enemy special forces! As I mentioned earlier, attack helicopters are good at finding enemy covert units, which is why we found this one so early. Now, use the attack helicopter to wipe both teams out. Be careful, they have portable anti-air missiles!"
4416 LANG "Our security checkpoint found an enemy spec-ops team trying to break into our territory! They're out of range to attack them, but the good news is, if a spec-ops team has been located, any other unit can attack them with ease. But, we'll pick a unit that's good at finding them anyway. Select the Army Base and send out an attack helicopter to take care of them.
Target the spec-ops team with an attack helicopter."
4415 LANG "Bomb Trucks are covert just like Spec-Ops. They're basically defenceless and blind, but they can carry nuclear weapons. Do you see the problem with well-hidden enemy units that can sneak thermonuclear bombs into our territory? I don't think I need to explain why that's a bad thing. This is why we need to be vigilant and have a strong defence against covert units.
Now, let's get that team home. Pick up that spec-ops team with the helicopter and get them back to the army base."
4414 LANG "Hold on, our helicopter found an enemy bomb truck! Order the helicopter to destroy it!"
4413 LANG "Let's quickly talk about Spec-Ops Helicopters. Spec-Ops Helicopters fly at low altitudes and can avoid detection just like Spec-Ops teams. Their main purpose is to move Spec-Ops Teams over long distances quickly, but they're also good at finding covert enemy units. Now go grab our boys in the field.
Select the spec-ops helicopter and right-click the spec-ops team to pick them up."
4412 LANG "Well done. Now, click our Army Base and send out a Spec-Ops helicopter to extract the team."
4411 LANG "Good work. Now destroy the second SAM site, and then we'll bring our Spec-Ops team home."
4410 LANG "They're in position. If you approach the SAM site from the east, you should be able to attack it without being detected by the security checkpoint. Take it out."
4409 LANG "Now that the team is loaded up, you can deploy them at the drop zone just like you would with an army division.
Move the submarine to the highlighted area to the southeast, and then order the spec-ops team to deploy to the other highlighted area."
4408 LANG "Looks like our Spec-Ops team is down and out. Let's deploy another one by submarine to take out that SAM. Then we can hit the security checkpoint with an airstrike. Attack Submarines can carry spec-ops teams, but other submarines can't.
Select the Spec-Ops team and right-click the attack submarine to load the Spec-Ops team onto the sub."
4407 LANG "It's good practice to keep security checkpoints around key assets to protect them from saboteurs. Keep in mind though, security checkpoints aren't well-hidden and will be easily spotted and destroyed by non-covert units."
4406 LANG "Security checkpoints specialize in finding covert enemy units and stopping them. Lots of units can see covert units when they're very close, but only a few are capable of easily spotting them from a distance. Security Checkpoints, Spec-Ops Helicopters, Attack Helicopters and Spec-Ops teams themselves all have this capability, so make sure you have some on hand to prevent the enemy from sneaking up on you."
4405 LANG "That's not good. It looks like they ran into an enemy security checkpoint."
4404 LANG "They had no idea we were coming. Too easy! Now let's take out that SAM site. Send the team over."
4403 LANG "Good. The team is armed with demolition charges for destroying enemy installations, and assault weapons to take out small groups of enemy infantry. They're deadly against small installations like radar and SAM sites, but don't expect them to take out well-guarded positions. If a unit has 'small arms' in their equipment, they can probably fend off or at least hurt a spec-ops team.
Now, send the team out to destroy that radar site."
4402 LANG "We can use spec-ops teams to deploy behind enemy lines and destroy crucial infrastructure like radars and SAM sites. Let's do that now.
Select the Spec Ops team near the Brazilian border."
4401 LANG "We have access to special units that can't be easily detected or identified by regular means such as radar or satellites. Special Operations, or 'Spec-Ops' teams are one such example. Spec-Ops teams are stealthy and trained to avoid detection by regular means, which means they'll only be seen by enemy forces when they're very close, unless they're specifically trained to spot them. The same is true for spec-ops helicopters, and bomb trucks. We'll cover all of them shortly."
4400 LANG "Welcome back, Commander. In this next exercise, we're going to talk about the quieter, more discreet side of war. There's no denying that nuclear weapons will get your point across, but sometimes you need a scalpel instead of a sledgehammer. That's where covert action comes in."


///TUTORIAL 9 - Space Warfare
4316 LANG "That's the basics of space warfare, but there's more to it than that once you scratch the surface. Now, you can return to the main menu, or we can talk about covert action."
4315 LANG "Well done, the enemy satellite is down. Now they can't spy on us, and they might think twice before they send up another satellite. Be warned, advanced laser satellites can intercept incoming ASATs, so it might be hard to shoot those ones down. Of course, if we have a laser that's big enough and the enemy satellite is close enough, that won't be a problem."
4314 LANG "Good. Now, you can only shoot down enemy satellites if you detect them with a space radar. Luckily, we have one now. So now we just need to attack the satellite with the ASAT we just built. Click our missile silo and arm it with the ASAT, and then you can either order it to attack the satellite manually, or tell it to auto-engage satellites while it has ASAT weapons equipped.
Now go kill that satellite!"
4313 LANG "There's a few different anti-satellite weapons available with different characteristics and launch platforms. There's nothing special about this satellite and we have a missile silo ready to go, so a regular ASAT will do.
Build an ASAT in the production menu, and then we can arm a missile silo with it."
4312 LANG "Lastly, hunter-killer satellites have anti-satellite weapons, also known as ASATs, and can shoot down other satellites. Speaking of which, we should kill off that enemy satellite now. There's a few ways to do this, but direct-ascent ground-based missiles are the simplest."
4311 LANG "Kinetic attack satellites can drop giant metal rods that smash into the ground and destroy everything around where they hit. We can use them to destroy enemy assets, but they're not quite destructive enough to be useful against cities."
4310 LANG "Laser defence satellites can shoot down incoming ballistic missiles within a certain range. They're good at what they do, but they're always moving which hurts their consistency. Use them to bolster your missile defences, but don't rely on them."
4309 LANG "Now if the satellite sees a missile taking off or in the air, we'll know about it. There's a few other types of satellites we could hypothetically deploy, but they're very difficult to design and build, so I'll just talk about them quickly."
4308 LANG "Early Warning Satellites can detect nuclear missile launches over a wide area, but can't see anything else. Like the name would suggest, they're good for providing early warning. Now place the early warning satellite."
4307 LANG "We found a satellite, which means they can spy on us. We could shoot down their satellite, but that might escalate things too much. We'll shoot it down later when we're in a better position. Let's build an early warning satellite in the meantime.
Go to the production menu and build a launch warning satellite."
4306 LANG "It might take a second before the satellite comes into view, assuming its orbit actually passes over the space radar. The better our space radar technology is, the wider the detection radius we'll have."
4305 LANG "Our satellite found something especially interesting. The enemy has their own space center, so they probably have their own satellites we don't know about. Let's build a space radar and see if we can find any.
Build a space radar and put it in Australia in the highlighted area."
4304 LANG "Now we can see what the enemy is up to. You can see the maximum range of the satellite's cameras as well as what it can see from its orbital path. Let's let it circle around and see what it can find..."
//4303 LANG "Now let's place it. [NEED CONTROLS]"
4303 LANG "Now let's place it. After you select it from the deployment menu, you can see the projected orbital path. Satellites follow a circular path all around the globe, so you'll have to consider that when you deploy them.
Place the satellite in such a way that its orbital path covers most of Russia."
4302 LANG "Good. Now, let's build a spy satellite. Spy satellites allow us to see what's happening in enemy territory as the satellite orbits overhead. What we can see and how much is dependent on how sophisticated our satellites are.
Build a spy satellite now."
4301 LANG "Before we can use satellites, we'll need two types of facilities on the ground. A space center, which we need to construct new satellites, and a relay station so we can transmit information to and from the satellites. We only need one of each, but you can build more than one if you want some redundancy.
Build a space operations center and a satellite relay station, and deploy them wherever you want. You can find them in the Space Warfare section."
4300 LANG "Welcome back, Commander. Next we're going to talk about assets in outer space. In essence, the types of satellites available, how to deploy them, what they can do, and of course, how to kill them. Getting control over space and building up a satellite network can be expensive and challenging, but it can also have a great payoff. Now, let's get started."

///TUTORIAL 8 - Missile Defence
4214 LANG "Those are the basics of missile defence. Remember, if your enemy knows what they're doing, you won't be able to shoot down their missiles forever. Missile defences can buy you some time and protect your key assets, but they won't save everyone! Now, you can return to the main menu, or we can talk about satellites."
4213 LANG "Lastly, just a quick note about point defence - certain units like warships can shoot down slower incoming missiles if they have CIWS or missile defence SAMs. These systems are only effective against weapons like cruise missiles but they can provide a lot of extra protection. They're not going to be much use against nuclear ballistic missiles though!"
4212 LANG "Counterforce attacks against the enemy's nuclear weapons are your best chance at minimizing the damage they can do to us. Be warned, it's messy and can put our own weapons in danger, so keep that in mind when you plan your strategy."
4211 LANG "Looks like the salvo is finished. Our early-warning radar has another advantage - it can calculate the launch positions for any missiles it detects, which means now we know exactly where the enemy silos are. I told you ABMs aren't always a reliable way to stop missiles. But do you know what's really reliable? Destroying their launchers before they can shoot at us again.
Order our missile silos to counterattack and destroy the enemy launch sites."
4210 LANG "Here they come..."
4209 LANG "Now let's see how our defences do. This is just an exercise, and like I said, missile defences are far from perfect, so if we take some hits, don't worry too much.
Unpause when you're ready."
4208 LANG "Lastly, we can also shoot down incoming missiles with lasers. Lasers are extremely reliable against individual warheads, but have very short ranges. They're good against weapons like hypersonic missiles or hypersonic glide vehicles, which are hard for regular ABM systems to hit.
Deploy a laser defence complex near the command center."
4207 LANG "Terminal ABMs have a very short range but are very effective against any targets that they can engage. They're also repositionable and can be used on advanced warships. They're best used as a last line of defense against anything that our midcourse systems can't intercept, and for protecting very specific assets. They also won't be fooled by decoy warheads.
To have an effective missile defence network, we'll need to layer midcourse and terminal ABM systems to give us good coverage."
4206 LANG "Midcourse ABMs hit enemy ballistic missiles while they're still in outer space. They can attack from long distances but have a minimum range requirement, which means if a missile gets close enough, the ABM site can't engage it. 
Now let's build some terminal ABMs. Build 2 terminal ABM sites near the command center."
4205 LANG "Now that we can detect missiles, we need a way to shoot them down. We can deploy midcourse and terminal anti-ballistic missile sites, or ABM sites for short. There's also point-defence weapons for tactical systems but we'll talk about those later. Let's start with some midcourse ABMs.
Our priority is to protect our missile silos and command structure. Place 3 midcourse ABM sites in the highlighted area."
4204 LANG "With the right upgrades, we can also use AWACS to detect incoming missiles. Early Warning satellites are another option. They're mobile and harder to hit, but have their own disadvantages too."
4203 LANG "Over-The-Horizon radar can detect incoming missiles from thousands of kilometers away, giving us as much time as possible to respond to an incoming attack. Even then, we'll barely have enough time to respond, but we'll have enough warning to shoot down incoming missiles."
4202 LANG "The most important part of a missile defence network is a way to know the missiles are coming in the first place. We'll need some early warning radars. Let's build some now. Select the Over-The-Horizon radars and put one in each of the highlighted areas."
4201 LANG "Let me preface this with a disclaimer. Our missile defences aren't going to save everyone. Mathematically, it's much, MUCH easier to attack with nuclear missiles than it is to shoot all of them down, ESPECIALLY once MIRVs come into the equation. Missiles are always going to get through and people are going to die. That's the reality of our situation.
But, a good missile defence system can help us protect a few critical assets and buy us some time. Now let's get into it."
4200 LANG "Welcome back, Commander. In this exercise, we're going to put together a missile defence network to protect our military assets and our major cities."


///TUTORIAL 7 - Naval Warfare
4124 LANG "Well done. Those are the basics of naval warfare. There's plenty of other tactics and technologies you can employ, but that should be enough to get you started. Now, you can return to the main menu, or learn about how missile defence works."
4123 LANG "Russia knows we're at war with East Asia. They're probably planning an attack right now, so let's get them first by surprise. Destroy their missile silos using our SSBN and take them while they're off-guard. By default, our submarines run deep to avoid detection. You'll have to bring the submarine close to the surface to fire the missiles.
Surface the sub and then attack the silos."
4122 LANG "This is an SSGN, or a cruise missile submarine. Like the name suggests, it fires cruise missiles, including nuclear ones. These are designed to take on enemy surface ships and overwhelm them with a hail of cruise missiles. They can also be used to quickly destroy targets on land as well."
4121 LANG "This is an SSN, or an Attack Submarine. These submarines specialize in destroying enemy warships, like carrier groups or other submarines. They are expensive, but very good at what they do. They can't do much else though. They can deploy special forces, but we'll talk about that later. Now select the submarine that's by itself."
4120 LANG "This submarine is known as an SSBN -  A ballistic missile submarine. It carries long-range, nuclear-armed ballistic missiles and can destroy enemy cities. We can use these like mobile, well-hidden underwater missile silos. They're very hard to find and destroy, so we can use them to take the enemy by surprise or as a second-strike option if they've destroyed our other weapons. Now, click one of the escorts."
4119 LANG "Let's talk about how to use submarines now. There's a few friendly submarines off the coast of Greenland. Go over there and select the submarine at the center of the wolfpack."
4118 LANG "Good work."
4117 LANG "There it is. Sink it using the helicopter's anti-submarine weapons."
4116 LANG "Intelligence indicates that there's an enemy SSBN off the coast of Vietnam, in the highlighted area. We don't know if it has an escort, and attack submarines can be deadly, so we should keep our distance. Select the carrier, sail close to Da Nang and then send a naval helicopter to find the submarine. Naval helicopters are good for finding enemy units and can sink enemy submarines. Regular warships can shoot them down easily though, so be careful."
4115 LANG "Now select the carrier and start hitting their cities with nuclear bombs. Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul and Osaka are your primary targets. Hit each of them a few times."
4114 LANG "Let's use our cruiser and the destroyers to soften their air defences. We'll use nuclear cruise missiles. Usually we would avoid using nukes to stop things from escalating, but we're past that point now.
Select the cruiser, toggle nuclear cruise missiles back on to enable them, and then start picking apart their defences.
Destroy all of East Asia's SAM sites."
4113 LANG "Resupply ships can be used to replenish any expendable weapons and repair friendly units within the resupply radius. We'll use it to make sure our carrier has plenty of bombs to drop.
Now, select the carrier and move the fleet to East Asia in the highlighted area."
4112 LANG "There's nothing we can do now, but we'll get our revenge... Let's pay East Asia a visit with our carrier group. Build a resupply ship in the production menu, and then add it to the carrier fleet. You can get a unit to follow an existing unit immediately by deploying it directly on top of it."
4111 LANG "Our over-the-horizon radar has picked up a missile launch from the ocean. There's a second submarine, and it's about to destroy the Eastern Seaboard!"
4110 LANG "Well done, but it's not over yet!"
4109 LANG "There it is! Attack and destroy the enemy submarine!"
4108 LANG "Good, now let's see if they find anything. Our intel suggests that the enemy has at least 2 SSBNs somewhere, and one was last seen in this part of the ocean..."
4107 LANG "Now, let's put our destroyers on a patrol course, to root out enemy submarines or give us advance warning of any enemy fleet movements.
Select the lead destroyer in the patrol and Shift-click a few points to have them move throughout the highlighted area to the left. Left-click an existing node to have the destroyers loop back around to that point and create a proper patrol circuit."
4106 LANG "Aircraft Carriers, unsurprisingly, carry aircraft. Use them to conduct airstrikes against enemy land and sea targets, and defend against opposing aircraft. Aircraft carriers can do incredible amounts of damage, but are vulnerable without an escort. Always keep them well protected!"
4105 LANG "Cruisers aren't as fast as destroyers and aren't as effective against enemy submarines, but they have much more firepower. Use cruisers to overwhelm and destroy enemy warships or targets on land using cruise missiles. They can also carry nuclear cruise missiles.
Lastly, select the aircraft carrier."
4104 LANG "Destroyers are relatively small and fast, and have good anti-missile defences. They're also good at detecting enemy submarines, which makes them good for patrols and protecting fleets from submarine attacks.
Now, select the cruiser."
4103 LANG "Let's talk broadly about each warship type before we put them to use. Select the destroyer."
4102 LANG "Good. It's worth noting that you only need to issue orders to the lead ship and the escorts will follow it around and attack any targets you assign. Later, we'll use this carrier group to attack an enemy faction with airstrikes, but for now, let's build a destroyer patrol.
Build a group of 2 destroyers and deploy them in the marked area, and then unpause."
4101 LANG "Let's start by deploying a fleet, with a carrier at the center. Click the carrier in the deployment menu, then click the cruiser once and the destroyer twice to have them escort the carrier. Then deploy the carrier group in the highlighted area."
4100 LANG "Welcome back, Commander. Our next exercise is a crash course in Naval Warfare. We'll discuss the different types of warships available and how to use them in a fleet, as well as how to use the various types of submarines."

///TUTORIAL 6 - Air power
4016 LANG "Now, you can either return to the main menu, or we can talk about naval warfare next."
4015 LANG "Excellent work. There are plenty of other ways to use airpower and I hope you experiment with different tactics and strategies, but this should give you a good foundation to work with."
4014 LANG "Well done. Now, to strike the enemy while avoiding going too deep into enemy territory, we can use our strategic bombers to launch nuclear ALBM strikes at Karachi, Mumbai and Bangalore. Hit them now."
4013 LANG "Good. Normally this would be a great time to exploit the enemy's weakness and invade them, but if we don't have time to build an army or there's a risk that they'll rebuild and retaliate, well, we can always just nuke them.
Select the Specialized Airbase, arm our high-speed bombers with 25MT weapons and destroy Delhi, Lahore and Kolkata."
4012 LANG "Now, where were we? Let's destroy those army bases. They're hard targets and we don't want to give the enemy time to respond, so let's turn up the heat. Equip your strategic bombers with nuclear ALBMs, and use them to destroy the enemy's army bases."
4011 LANG "Lastly, there are high-speed bombers. High-speed bombers are very fast and can carry heavy bombs, but can't use guided weapons or missiles. They are difficult to shoot down because of their speed, but they can't attack from a distance and require specialized airbases to take off from."
4010 LANG "Secondly, we have multirole attack aircraft, which are similar to fighters. They can use air-to-air weapons and small air-to-ground weapons, but can't carry heavy bombs or ballistic missiles. They can carry nuclear cruise missiles though, which makes them great against light targets. You'll find these attached to minor airbases or aircraft carriers."
4009 LANG "The first type is regular strategic bombers. They can carry any type of bomb or air-to-ground weapon and can also use air-launched ballistic missiles, which have more range than free-fall bombs and are therefore safer to use, but not as destructive. Strategic bombers can also fly very long distances but are slow."
4008 LANG "Good. Now that we have destroyed the enemy's air power and their air defences, we can freely attack them with planes. Let's talk about the bombers we have available. There are 3 major types."
4006 LANG "Now select the specialized airbase and select the Electronic Warfare (EW) aircraft, and tell them to destroy the SAM sites. Electronic warfare planes are designed to confuse enemy radar and make our units harder to detect until they're close to the enemy. They also have special missiles designed to home in on radar emissions, just like the ones that SAM sites put out.
Take note that the enemy is scrambling jets to attack our planes as soon as they can detect them. Since we have AWACS, we can spot and engage enemy fighters sooner and keep an advantage. Winning in air combat is heavily dependent on technological advantages and numbers, but advantages like AWACS support and electronic warfare will also make a difference.
Keep attacking until the sites and air bases are destroyed. If the attack fails, build more aircraft and keep pushing."
4005 LANG "Now we're going to use a two-pronged strike to wipe out the enemy's airbases and SAM sites. Select the regular airbases and give them orders to attack their nearest enemy airbase."
4004 LANG "Good. Now we'll launch our own AWACS to provide surveillance and support our own operations. Select the eastern airbase, sortie an AWACS and get it to patrol the point I've highlighted. This will be helpful for detecting enemy aircraft in the next phase."
4003 LANG "You can see there's multiple types of aircraft. The 2nd from the left is an interceptor. Interceptors are very fast and have long-range missiles, making them great at destroying large enemy aircraft like bombers, AWACS and transports, but they're not very good at fighting smaller aircraft like fighters and can't engage as many targets. They'll be perfect for destroying that AWACS before they can scramble jets though.
Launch an interceptor and shoot down the enemy AWACS."
4002 LANG "Let's start by destroying their AWACS. If you'll remember, AWACS are very good at spotting enemy aircraft, which will make it easier for the enemy to scramble planes and fight us off. If we can destroy their AWACS, they'll have a harder time fighting us. We'll use an interceptor to shoot it down.
Select the highlighted airbase when you're ready."
4001 LANG "Our first objective is to take out anything that can threaten our air force, namely enemy aircraft and air defence sites. Let's assume we've already found their air base and SAM site locations using spy planes or satellites. Now we need to destroy them, and if we're using air power, airstrikes are the way to go."
4000 LANG "Welcome back, Commander. In this next exercise we're going to talk about air power. I'll teach you about the different types of aircraft available, then I'll show you how to secure air dominance and then use it to destroy enemy units and cities. Let's get started."

///TUTORIAL 5 - Sensors
3914 LANG "Now, you can either return to the main menu, or we can talk about air power and start dropping some bombs!"
3913 LANG "Now we have a basic idea on how to find enemy units. If we can spy on our enemies, we can figure out what they're planning, and use that against them. Never underestimate the power of reconnaissance!"
3912 LANG "Jackpot! There's an enemy submarine sitting right off our coast. Think about how much damage it could do if we never found it."
3911 LANG "We can see surface ships and surfaced submarines on radar easily, just like land units, but submerged submarines are harder. Submarines can only be detected by sonar when they're underwater, and advanced submarines are even better at evading sonar detection. That's not going to stop us though.
Build a naval monitoring station and put it in the highlighted area, then unpause. You can find them under 'Fixed Military Sites'."
3910 LANG "We have a decent idea of how to survey the ground. There's also satellites and special forces we can use, but we'll talk about that in a different exercise. What about the ocean?"
3909 LANG "Our spy plane found an enemy air base. Great, now that we know where it is, we can suspect they'll use it to attack Europe. We can also look at the air base and tell they have supersonic bombers."
3908 LANG "Spy planes are very hard to shoot down, so they can fly deep into enemy territory to find enemy installations. They have a small detection range, so they'll have to make lots of flights to cover everything."
3907 LANG "Certain units are particularly hard to detect, and won't be detected until they're closer. Underground missile silos, units with stealth technology and specialized covert units are a few examples. Let's send our AWACS back and try something else.
Select our specialized airbase, and send a spy plane over Moscow."
3906 LANG "Hmm. We found a missile silo, but it's well within our radar range. We had to get closer to it before our radar picked up."
3905 LANG "See? We found an enemy army base. Let's go a little further. Fly closer to London."
3904 LANG "If you select the AWACS you can see it has an air detection range, as well as a ground detection range. AWACS can provide constant surveillance and are great at detecting aircraft and missiles, but aren't as good at detecting ground units. Still, they can be useful. As the AWACS flies into enemy territory, it will pick up enemy units once they come within range."
3903 LANG "Radar sites are a good way to detect incoming enemy units like aircraft and warships, but they can't see very far into enemy territory. Let's send in something that can. Select the airbase, and send out an AWACS plane towards London. Make sure the game is unpaused."
3902 LANG "You can see that there's two different sensor ranges attached to the radar site: Targeting Radar and Search Radar. The search radar has a wider range, and is how far the radar can detect enemy units under regular circumstances. The targeting radar works on short-wave frequencies and tracks the target accurately enough that you can hit it with weapons. To use most guided weapons, you'll need precision targeting, which means you'll need the target to be in range of a targeting radar."
3901 LANG "We'll start with one of the simpler and more obvious ways of finding enemy units: Fixed radar sites. Select the radar site that I've highlighted, over in Turkiye."
3900 LANG "Welcome back, Commander. Let's talk about reconnaissance and sensors. This is important, because almost nothing will give you a better advantage over your enemy than knowing what they're going to do so you can prepare for it. Our spy network will be an important part of that, but we'll also have to take matters into our own hands. To locate enemy units, we'll need our own units, and their sensors. So, let's get started."

///TUTORIAL 4 - Occupation
3820 LANG "That's the basics of capturing territory and using armies. Capturing territory is good early on, but be careful trying it once the enemy has a well-developed nuclear force. If you push them too far, be ready for things to escalate. Now, you can either return to the main menu, or learn about reconnaissance and sensors."
3819 LANG "Now that we control the entirety of Burma, we'll have access to its GDP once it's fully assimilated. You can see the assimilation progress in the region menu. We've also weakened the Asia-Pacific faction quite a bit by doing that, since fully occupying a city cuts off their GDP access immediately."
3818 LANG "Congratulations! Burma is now ours."
3817 LANG "To fully capture the territory, we need to wait until all the cities in it are fully occupied. Army divisions will occupy any cities that are within their occupation radius, and once they start occupying, a timer will start counting down showing how long it will take before the city is fully occupied. The bigger and more important a city is, the longer it will take to occupy. Once every city in a territory is occupied, that territory will be captured.
Now we just need to wait until we've fully occupied all the cities. Entrench the army at Yangon, so we can hold off any enemy counterattacks, and then wait for the territory to capitulate.
It might also be worth clicking a city and opening the territory menu for Burma!"
3816 LANG "Good. Now the forward operating base can repair any units within its radius, including our army division. That should help them hold the line.
Now let's finish our mission. Pan over back to Sri Lanka and then airdrop our last army division into Yangon."
3815 LANG "Good. Now let's give the combat engineers something they can deploy. Take a Forward Operating Base from the menu on the left and drop it on to the combat engineers, and then deploy it in the highlighted area so it can support our forces at Naypyidaw and Yangon."
3814 LANG "Our armies at Mandalay and Naypyidaw held the line but the enemy was willing to nuke themselves to make sure we lost at Yangon. Not the most tactful move... We'll send in another army division to capture it, and use Combat Engineers to support them.
But first, use air power and missile strikes to take out that enemy division. You might need to send a bomber to scout out its location again first."
3813 LANG "All our troops are in place and are occupying the enemy cities. We can expect an imminent counterattack though. Let's see if we can hold the line..."
3812 LANG "Now, we'll use our army base in Sri Lanka to deploy the last army by plane. First, pan the map south so you can see the base, and then move the third army into the army base to load them onto transport planes. Then, select our army base, and then click the transport plane. You can send it out like any other plane, or shift-click to have it automatically drop whatever unit it has at a certain location.
Use the transport plane to deploy the last army at Yangon."
3811 LANG "The enemy is probably getting ready to counterattack. We can entrench to make our armies immobile but much more defendable, and also allow them to use their anti-aircraft guns. Entrenching takes time to do, so order it in advance. Armies will also entrench automatically if they don't get orders for a while.
Entrench the armies once they reach Mandalay and Naypyidaw."
3810 LANG "Good. Now do the same thing with the other army. If you're worried about getting attacked, it's best to keep your armies in 'assault mode' when moving them. Either way, send the army to Naypyidaw."
3809 LANG "The army is now in 'assault mode' which means it's capable of moving and attacking at the same time. Raise the state again to get it into transport mode."
3808 LANG "There's probably no risk of an immediate counterattack, and speed is of the essence, so let's rush our forces in by putting them in 'Transport Mode'. Transport mode makes army divisions more vulnerable and unable to shoot, but they'll move a lot more quickly. This can be a dangerous maneuver if you're not careful, but it should be okay for now.
Set that army to 'transport mode' using the unit menu to make it move faster. Click the upward and downward pointing arrows to change the state of a unit. You'll have to 'raise' the state of the army division twice to get it into transport mode.
Unpause, and give it a try."
3807 LANG "Good job! But now the enemy knows what we're up to. We have to send in our troops now while they're off-guard. We'll send in two armies over land and use our army base to deploy a third one using transport planes.
You can right-click to issue 'move' orders. Select the army and send it to Mandalay. Be careful to MOVE the army to Mandalay, and not attack, because armies are capable of razing cities and we don't want to take that step just yet."
3806 LANG "Good. Now we have to worry about the enemy armies and their bases. Armies are hard to destroy and can form a frontline to stop other armies from advancing. Army bases can do the same thing, but they can't move. Armies also have to rely on other units for air defence, which makes them vulnerable to air strikes if they're undefended. Let's take advantage of that.
Select our air base and send planes to destroy the enemy army bases. They're hard targets, so it will take a few passes. Feel free to use the SRBM launcher to hit them as well."
3805 LANG "The enemy has SAM sites which will destroy our planes if they get too close. Upgraded SAMs can also shoot down enemy missiles, which is something to consider. But these ones aren't that lucky. We could nuke them, but that hurts the territory we want to capture, and we don't want things to get too out of hand just yet...
Launch conventional SRBMs at the SAM sites and destroy them all. You can queue attacks by holding ctrl and clicking targets in sequence."
3804 LANG "The enemy has built up some defences to try and stop us. We can send in our army divisions to destroy them, but we want to avoid casualties where we can and maximize our chances of winning, so we'll use other units to back them up. Let's destroy their air defences with missiles, and then use our air force to weaken their ground forces so our own armies can destroy them. We'll also send in combat engineers to build a forward base, which will allow our units to repair and rearm in enemy territory.
Start by selecting our SRBM TEL vehicle."
3803 LANG "Capturing a territory will give us access to all its resources and its GDP, and also allow us to freely build new units on it. Your score will also increase when you capture an enemy territory, and you'll gain more points depending on how populated it is.
Now, we're going to invade Burma."
3802 LANG "In the bottom left, you can see the menu for West India, which is a territory we control. You can see that there's 5 cities in the territory. Every territory has at least one city in it, and to capture a territory, we'll need to send in armies to occupy those cities, which is what we'll be doing. You can also see the strength of the territory's economic sectors, a descriptor based on how its GDP output is split, how badly irradiated it is, and how many people are still alive."
3801 LANG "First, let's talk about territory. Click on Mumbai to bring up the menu for the territory it's in."
3800 LANG "Welcome back, Commander. So far we've nuked a city for fun, destroyed a few airports and learned about the magic of transactional friendship, but now it's time to get serious about our strategy. Our next lesson is to conduct a full-scale attack and capture enemy territory."

///TUTORIAL 3 - Diplomacy and Espionage
3728 LANG "And that covers the basics of diplomacy and espionage. They may not be flashy, but they can make a huge difference if you can use them to your advantage properly. Now, you can return to the main menu, or we can get into the REAL action and learn how to invade and capture enemy territory."
3727 LANG "The Geneva Convention is a binding agreement that affects every faction in the world. It controls which weapons and technologies can and can't be used, as well as the global peace timer and the no-nuke timer.
Any faction can submit a proposal for the Geneva Convention, but as usual, at least half of the factions will have to agree for it to take effect. It's also worth noting that there's no way to break the Geneva Convention. The global no-nuke and peace timers can't be bypassed, and any weapons or technologies that are banned can't be used at all unless they're unbanned later.
That being said, anything that's NOT banned is fair play, so enjoy your nerve gas and your cobalt bombs while you can."
3726 LANG "Now, we could do a couple of deals to demonstrate how they work, but they generally offer long-term strategic advantages and are pretty straightforward, so there's not much point and it wouldn't be very exciting. Instead, let's move on to the last topic: The Geneva Convention. Click on the Geneva Convention tab on the right side of the screen."
3725 LANG "As you might have been able to guess, agreements within alliances only pass if a majority of the members vote in favor. You can vote to invite new factions (which doesn't guarantee that they'll join, they'll just be given the option) as well as vote to kick factions out.
Also take note, you can still make deals with factions outside of the alliance, as well as deals exclusively between you and one of the alliance members. So if you added South America to the alliance, you could still cut a deal with Sub-Saharan Africa that South America isn't involved in, for example."
3724 LANG "Now, as a member of an alliance, you have a few resolutions you can pass that will apply to you and all your allies. Most of these you probably recognize from the factional agreements, but you also have the option to let your allies build on your territory and vice versa, share all of your new research with each other as soon as you discover it, and also enter a Mutual Defence Treaty, which means to say, if a war starts between an alliance member and another faction, the entire alliance will automatically declare war in support. This also applies if your ally is the one that starts the war."
3723 LANG "That's the name you're going with? That's... Sure. Whatever. Moving on."
3722 LANG "Being part of an alliance means now we can form agreements with everybody in the alliance, and there's other factions that we can trust and rely on.
Well, probably.
The agreements will become more significant if the alliance gets more members. But first, let's change the name of the alliance. By default, it's taken on the name 'Red Alliance'. Double-click the name to change it to something a little more inspiring. Remember, millions of people are going to die, so you should probably pick a name that people will take seriously."
3721 LANG "Now press the 'Alliance Settings' button to see what we can do now that we're part of a team."
3720 LANG "Well done! We've formed an alliance. Now, let's see what we can do with it. Click our faction on the left side to bring us back to our overview screen."
3719 LANG "Hmm, they've made us a counteroffer. It looks like they're willing to form an alliance, but they want us to sweeten the deal first by sending them a cruiser. Luckily, they can only ask for things that we're in a position to provide, which means to say we have a cruiser in reserve that we can give them. As a sign of good faith, we'll accept the counteroffer and give them the cruiser. Now, accept the offer."
3718 LANG "With all that aside, let's try and make a new friend. Click the 'Partnership' button to add it to the trade menu, which you can see in the top right. Then press 'Offer' to make the deal, and we'll see if they accept."
3717 LANG "Partnerships and Cooperation deals are mutually exchanged, but there are also more asymmetric deals you can make as well.
You can trade your intel on other factions, military hardware that you haven't deployed yet, and even entire territories if they share a land border with the other faction.
If you need to put pressure on a particular enemy, you can also offer or request a declaration of war.
Lastly, you can also offer an industrial contribution, where a percentage of your production GDP is transferred to the other faction for a period of time. This can be useful if you want to support a friendly faction but can't send your own units to fight directly."
3716 LANG "You can also create a cooperation agreement without becoming allies. If you click 'Cooperation' you'll see a few options.
If you cooperate on production or research, both factions gain a bonus based on how efficient the other is, so cooperating with factions with strong research or production capabilities will give you a better bonus.
Cooperating on intelligence also provides a boost, and also means that any espionage either faction conducts will be shared between both of them.
Cooperating on radar data and nuclear assets will allow you to see the other faction's sensor data (and the units providing them) and the location of their hidden nuclear assets respectively. This can be very useful if you're fighting a war together, but also makes both factions extremely vulnerable to betrayal..."
3715 LANG "The first option is to form a partnership. You'll start a new alliance with the faction and your standing will go from Neutral to Allied. This opens the door to a lot of possibilities, but we'll cover alliances in a moment after we form one."
3714 LANG "We have a few different proposals we could make. Let's go over them quickly."
3713 LANG "This is what the faction overview looks like for factions other than yours. From this screen, you can see which units and warheads we know the faction has, their known technologies and who they're at war with. Also worth noting, the tab on the left that you clicked to get here shows you their population, how many territories they control, the strength of their different GDP sectors, their current standing with you, and how many points they have.
With that aside, let's make a deal."
3712 LANG "Now, let's talk about diplomacy. Underneath the espionage section, you can see the agreements section, including a table that shows any agreements you have between other factions. Agreements can be a huge boon if there's another faction you can trust, but they can also put you at risk of being betrayed if you're not careful. Now, let's form an agreement.
Sub-Saharan Africa is far away from Russia so they likely won't pose a major threat to us, and we're likely going to have a common enemy in the form of Middle East-North Africa, so we can probably trust them. Well, as much as you can trust anyone, anyway.
Click on Sub-Saharan Africa on the left side of the screen."
3711 LANG "That's a fairly brief summary of how espionage works. It's relatively simple, but if you can go a step further and use it to figure out your enemy's strategy, it can give you a massive advantage. Don't underestimate it!"
3710 LANG "Lastly, you have the option to try and steal enemy technology. In order to do this, you need to be aware of a technology that your enemy has that you don't. You have the option to target a specific technology to improve your odds of stealing it, but that doesn't guarantee that you'll get it and it doesn't mean you won't discover other technologies either.
While your spies are trying to steal a technology, they'll incrementally uncover information that will give you progress towards unlocking it. You can either use that as a headstart if you choose to research it yourself, or if you wait long enough, your spies might steal enough information to discover it completely. Keep in mind, if it's important, it's probably best not to leave it to chance."
3709 LANG "'Counter-Intelligence' will make it harder for other factions to spy on you with their own espionage programs. If you don't have any secrets worth stealing or are convinced you're far ahead enough that it won't make a difference, consider turning it off. Otherwise, it's best if they don't know what you're up to."
3708 LANG "Next is 'Identify Unit/Weapon Stockpiles' and 'Identify Technologies'. These will show you what units and weapons the enemy has stockpiled in reserve, as well as what technologies they possess respectively. You can see these in the overview for each faction, but we'll get to that in a second."
3707 LANG "Which brings us to the 'Discover Active Research' mission. Similar to the previous mission, it will tell you which technology the enemy is currently trying to research."
3706 LANG "The 'Discover Current Production' mission will periodically tell you what the enemy factions are building at that moment in time. If you look at the faction list on the left, you can see two boxes with question marks. If and when you have the relevant information, one box will tell you what the enemy is building, and the other will tell you what they are researching."
3705 LANG "The 'Locate Assets' mission will periodically uncover the location of hidden enemy units, so you can easily destroy them or keep track of them."
3704 LANG "There's a couple of different espionage mission types available. Espionage missions are carried out passively and continuously over time and feed information to you automatically.
The fewer mission types you assign, the more effort will go into completing the ones that are active. Similarly, if you spy on fewer factions, you can get more intel on the ones you're focused on.
You don't have to worry about constantly assigning new missions, just tell the spies what information you want and they'll keep getting it. Let's go over the mission types quickly."
3703 LANG "In the top half, you can see the espionage menu. From here, you can pick which factions we're performing espionage actions on, as well as what kinds of missions we're conducting. Espionage is a great way to get information on your enemies and figure out what they're up to. If you know what they're planning, you'll know how to beat them!"
3702 LANG "The diplomacy menu gives you an overview of every active faction, including yours. Right now we're looking at the overview for our own faction, which is a little different from the others."
3701 LANG "Working with other factions and having an effective espionage program isn't quite as cinematic as full-scale invasions or mass nuclear attacks, but it can prepare you for what's coming and also give you a strategic edge. Now, let's get into it. Open the Diplomacy tab at the bottom of the screen."
3700 LANG "Welcome back, Commander. In this next exercise we're going to talk about how to leverage diplomacy and espionage to give us an advantage over our opponents on the world stage."

///TUTORIAL 2 - Research and Production
3622 LANG "Well done. Now, you can either return to the main menu, or we can talk about espionage and diplomacy."
3621 LANG "Great. Now, let's finish the exercise by placing the ballistic missile site, arming it with nuclear weapons, and destroying the enemy air bases. The maximum attack range of the missile site is displayed in red. Make sure you place it so that it can hit both targets!"
3620 LANG "Good. You can also shift-click to add things straight to the front of the queue in the future too. Now we'll just wait for everything to finish being built.
Unpause the game."
3619 LANG "For good measure, we can bring that army division to the front of the build queue so it gets built first. Shift-click the army division that's already in the build queue to move it to the top, so it starts construction immediately."
3618 LANG "Our ballistic missile site is ready, but it might be good to have another army, just in case. Add an army division to the build queue."
3617 LANG "We can also speed up our production by sacrificing some of our research budget to it. We have a 50/50 split between research and production, but we're not researching anything, so you can move the slider to set the budget to 100% production.
Also take note, right now we only have really basic nuclear enrichment technology, so you can see on the right side of the screen that we can only build nuclear weapons at 20% efficiency, which isn't great. If we research better nuclear enrichment methods, then our efficiency will go up and we can make more nukes faster.
Now, finish the production run."
3616 LANG "Good, now we have access to short-range ballistic missiles. They're not very accurate, so normally you would want to upgrade their inertial guidance systems to reliably hit tough targets with them. Of course, we can also improve our odds by using nuclear warheads!
Let's put this new technology to the test: Add a ballistic missile site to the production queue, and then go to the weapon production tab and add 5 nuclear SRBMs to the production queue for it to use. You can add 5 of something to the queue by pressing ALT."
3615 LANG "Good. Now we need to wait for the scientists to do their work. If we invest in technology to help them research faster or build research centers, they can do their work more quickly. Improving our economy by controlling more territory will also raise our research budget and make them work faster. Technology can also be stolen from other factions, but we'll talk about that in the next exercise.
Finish researching the 'Early Ballistic Missiles' tech, and make sure the game is unpaused."
3614 LANG "If a technology is above our Total Tech Level, there's a penalty and we won't be able to research it as quickly, so it will be better to research other less advanced tech to get our Total Tech Level higher first. If you go to the Aircraft Technology tab, you'll see we have Long Range Bombers, so we could start researching Early Supersonic Bombers, but we're not that advanced yet, so it would take longer.
Instead, let's research 'Early Ballistic Missiles'. It's within our current tech level so there's no penalty. You can probably guess which tab that's under."
3613 LANG "Great, now our armies are better equipped.
Let's quickly talk about tech levels. If you open the research menu, you can see at the top that we're currently at 'Tech Level 2'. Advanced technologies have prerequisites we need to fill first, but we also need to make sure our technology level is up to par too. Researching technologies will raise our Total Tech Level, and our total tech level determines how fast we can develop cutting-edge technology. You can see that unlocking those two techs increased our total tech level progress."
3612 LANG "Now we just have to wait some more. Just to be perfectly clear, you can do other things while you wait for something to finish being built or researched, and the research and production will take place in the background. It's always good to keep your researchers and factories busy, otherwise they'll just sit around and their budget will go towards espionage instead, but we'll cover that later.
Finish researching the two technologies. Make sure the game is unpaused."
3611 LANG "Good. Better vehicles will make our armies faster and better in a fight. They'll need better weapons too. Let's queue 'Weapon Modernization' so that it starts as soon as our last tech is done being researched. Click the weapon modernization tech to add it to the queue, or shift-click to bring it to the front of the queue. We'll need both, so it doesn't matter."
3610 LANG "This is the research menu. Here we can research new technology to unlock new units and capabilities, as well as upgrade our existing equipment. Keeping a technological edge will be crucial if we want to outmatch our enemies.
Our troops are using outdated vehicles. Let's upgrade our armored vehicles. Go to the 'Ground Forces' tab and click on 'Early Infantry Fighting Vehicles' to begin researching it."
3609 LANG "Good. That's the basics of producing units. Simple, right? Some units have consumable weapons that have to be produced the same way, but I'm sure you can figure that out. Speaking of weapons, it looks like ours are outdated.
Let's go to the research menu. You can access it from the bottom of the screen, or open the production menu and swipe your mouse over to the left side to swap to it."
3608 LANG "The armies are done being produced now, so let's deploy them. Armies can only be deployed close to an army base. Deploy them now."
3607 LANG "Good. Now the army base can attack any enemies that come by, and we can build armies now. Go to the production menu and queue and build 2 army divisions. You can find them under the 'Mobile Ground Units' tab. Don't worry about deploying them yet. Don't forget that you can change the game speed!"
3606 LANG "With that aside, we have an army base ready to deploy, now we just need to place it somewhere. Close the production menu, then on the left side of the screen, click the army base to select it, and then click on the map to deploy it. Build it in the area I've highlighted."
3605 LANG "And it's ready. Take note of the news feed in the top left, that tells you whenever a significant event happens. You can click the newsfeed and check or uncheck events if you want the game to pause when something happens. You can also click 'Nuclear War Mode' to toggle all notifications on or off, which is useful if there's a lot happening at once and you don't want to be bothered. You can also manually edit the defaults in the options menu to suit your preferences."
3604 LANG "Now we just have to wait..."
3603 LANG "Some units require you to have another unit before you can build them. Satellites need a space center, armies need an army base, and so on. Units don't cost us any money, but they do take time to build. Let's wait for that army base to finish building.
Unpause the game."
3602 LANG "Now, we want to build army divisions, but we can't because we don't have any army bases built yet. Let's build an army base. Click the 'Army Base' icon to add it to the production queue."
3601 LANG "Let's start by building some units. There's enemy forces that are in position to invade us. Let's make some army divisions to make them think twice. Click the production icon at the bottom of the screen."
3600 LANG "Welcome back, Commander. We'll be covering how to produce new units and develop new technologies to give our forces new capabilities and advantages."

///TUTORIAL 1 - Will post others in sequence to avoid mass redos
3515 LANG "Well done. This is just a scenario, but the real thing won't be nearly as simple. We've only covered the basics. Select the next tutorial or return to the main menu."
3514 LANG "The bomber has taken off. This is just a taste of what's in store..."
3513 LANG "Now that our bombers are using heavy nuclear bombs, let me remind you what this is all about. Let's destroy an enemy city. To target a city or enemy unit, select a friendly unit and either press 'attack' or hold control, and then click what you want to attack, or you can also just left-click your target if it's clearly visible or you know its location.
Select the airbase and target Moscow."
3512 LANG "Changing the weapon loadout will make all the bombers at that particular airbase use those weapons when you scramble them.
You may have noticed that some weapons are marked in red and yellow. Those ones have special, limited ammunition that has to be ordered. Yellow means the weapon is available, red means it's not.
Now, let's try something else. Let's change the loadout for all of our airbases to use nuclear bombs. Open the loadout again and shift-click the 10MT Heavy Bomb. That will change the loadout type for every airbase we have. You can do the same thing for any other unit too, like missile silos or submarines."
3511 LANG "Now, let's practice changing weapons. Select the airbase again and click the button underneath the bomber icon to change the loadout. You can mouse over each loadout to see the weapons it contains. Try changing the loadout to air-launched cruise missiles, or ALCMs for short."
3510 LANG "Good! You can also toggle the 'Air Patrol' buttons to have the airbase automatically have planes patrol around the base. Regardless if you tell them to patrol or not, airbases will automatically send out fighters to attack enemy planes if they pose a threat to us. Many other units will also attack in self-defence, but most won't move unless you order them to, with the exception of planes."
3509 LANG "Let's take a closer look at the unit menu now. You can see how many planes the airbase has, which weapons they have equipped, their radars and sensors, and how much health the airbase has left. You can issue certain orders to the airbase from this menu.
Let's send out a fighter. Click the 'fighter' icon or press and hold 'Z' to select it, and then left click on the map to send it out. Make sure not to send it out so far that it runs out of fuel!"
3508 LANG "Alright, now we know how to select units. Now let's learn how to actually command them.
Select the airbase that I've highlighted."
3507 LANG "Lastly, you can assign a group of units to a hotkey, so you can quickly select all of them and give them an order on a whim.
To do that, just select all the units you want in the group, then press ctrl and then one of the function keys, like F1 or F2. That will assign that group to that function key. Alternatively, you can press the 'plus' icon at the top of the unit menu to form the group and name it.
So for example, you could select a carrier group, then press ctrl + F1, and then that group will be selected every time you press F1.
You can assign up to 9 groups like this, from F1 to F9. Play around with it and press OK once you're ready."
3506 LANG "When you have a group of units selected, you can also narrow your selection down. For example, if you select a carrier group, you can cycle between the ships in the group using the icons on the right side of the unit menu.
Using that menu on the right, if you shift-click an icon, you'll narrow your selection down to every unit of the same type in that group. So, shift-clicking a destroyer would select all the destroyers.
Conversely, if you ctrl-click an icon, it will keep the rest of the group, but exclude the unit type you clicked. So similarly, if you selected a carrier group, ctrl-clicking the destroyer icon would limit the selection to just the carrier and the cruiser.
These controls can be handy if you have a formation of units but need specific ones to do specific jobs."
3505 LANG "Let's talk about selecting units. If you want to select a single unit, you can do so just by clicking on it.
You can also click and drag to select multiple units as a group, or double-click a unit to select every unit of that unit type, like all of your armies, or all of your airbases, for example.
Try selecting a few units, and press OK when you're ready."
3504 LANG "You can control the pace of the game if you're waiting for something to happen or need some time to think. In single-player, you can do this on a whim, but in multiplayer you get a 'time pool' that gives you control for a little while, so you don't hold up the game for too long."
3503 LANG "Now, try changing the speed of the game. Click the buttons around the pause button in the bottom right, or press 1, 2, 3 and 4 on your keyboard to pick a game speed."
3502 LANG "Great. Now that you can move the camera around, pan back over to Europe and we'll go over the time controls.
The game is paused right now, so let's unpause. You can pause or unpause time by pressing 'Space'."
3501 LANG "Let's start with some basic commands. First, let's get our bearings. Use the WASD keys or arrow keys to look around, or drag your mouse to the edge of the screen.
You can also switch between a flat map and a globe view by pressing M. Zoom in and out using Q and E, or using the scroll wheel.
Take a look around and press OK when you're ready."
3500 LANG "Hello Commander, it's a pleasure to meet you. Welcome to ICBM: Escalation.
My name is General Thomas Charr, and I'll be training you on your new assignment. Your job is to command our nation's strategic and nuclear forces to ensure our survival and defeat our enemies. I've set up some training scenarios to help you. Follow along closely. You can restart if you make a mistake, but if you're going to be in control of hundreds of nuclear warheads, well, mistakes are bad.
Now, let's get started."

2572 LANG "Now deploy the Over-The-Horizon radar to detect the ballistic missiles!\n\nEven the fully upgraded anti-missile defence cannot protect your cities against the missiles it cannot see. Over-The-Horizon radar is the primary mean of missile detection and tracking. The conventional radars have too short of a range and are not suited to tracking targets flying high in space, so they usually fail to give your anti-missile defence sufficient time to react to the threat."
2571 LANG "You have completed the tutorial Now it's time to start Thermonuclear War!"
2570 LANG "A lot of different events will be happening almost simultaneously, so it makes sense to put the Journal into the Nuclear War mode, meaning the game will not auto-pause anymore.\n\nClick the Nuclear War Mode button, then unpause the game and watch your units bring death and destruction to your enemy!"
2569 LANG "Upause the game to continue."
2568 LANG "Now click the Execute \"Plan Alpha\" to let your carriers disarm the enemy."
2567 LANG "Your bombers are now close enough to enemy territory, now it's time to disable the enemy's defences.\n\nWhile the time to execute your Plan Alpha is significantly shorter than the remaining time to Armageddon, you should expect your enemy to notice your mass attack, so it's better to disable him beforehand."
2566 LANG "You can see your missile silos and SSBNs went into Wait mode, while your airbases are flushing the bombers.\n\nUnpause the game to continue."
2565 LANG "Note that Armageddon plan is longer set to execute - this is because it takes a significant time for all bombers to leave air bases and reach their targets.\n\nNow click the Execute \"Plan Armageddon\" option - this will trigger the attack."
2564 LANG "There are two icons representing your strike plans in the bottom left of the screen.\n\nEach icon has the execution time printed on it - this is the time required for the last warheads to reach selected targets.\n\nYou may hover your mouse over the plan icon to read it."
2563 LANG "Plan Armageddon is planned, now it's time to execute!\n\nClick OK button to close the Strike Planner."
2562 LANG "And finally, assign this plan a new icon - click the Radiation icon in the top left corner of the Strike Planner window."
2561 LANG "Select SSBN, Air base and Missile silo as Attackers and then City as a Target."
2560 LANG "Now let's create another strike plan, this time for your Strategic Nuclear Forces!\n\nClick on the \"New Strike Plan\" button."
2559 LANG "The Faction column allows you to limit your attack to  specific regional targets only.\n\nThe settings row outlines the details of the strike plan.\n\nAuto Continue means your units will continue selecting and attacking new targets after the initial strike plan is executed.\n\nSynchronize Attack means all attacking units are to coordinate their actions.\n\nTimed Destruction means your units will time their attack to land the warheads on all selected targets almost simultaneously.\n\nClick OK button to finalize your Plan Alpha."
2558 LANG "Now click on the SAM site icon and then click on it again - this will make it the secondary Target."
2557 LANG "The middle column lists the unit types your attackers should consider - the Targets.\n\nClick on the Air base, Missile silo and Over-the-horizon radar icons. This will tell your carrier groups to primarily target these unit types."
2556 LANG "This screen allows you to automate a massive strike.\n\nThe left column lists the unit types you can guide - the Attackers.\n\nClick on the Carrier icon to plan the actions for your carrier groups."
2555 LANG "To avoid micro-managing dozens of units, you have the Strike Planner.\n\nClick on the \"New Strike Plan\" button in the bottom left corner of the screen."
2554 LANG "In this scenario you have carrier groups that are to deal with the enemy's defences and attack capabilities.\n\nThen you have your own missile silos, nuclear subs and strategic bombers to level  the enemy cities."
2553 LANG "Now let's play Armageddon!\n\nIf you want to score more in the game, you need to execute a massive nuclear strike on the enemy while ensuring he is not able to respond. This requires the precise timing and coordination between your units."
2552 LANG "Mission 7 completed.\n\nClick OK to move on to Mission 8."
2551 LANG "Destroy the highlighted objects with nuclear strikes!\nBetter to target all three enemy ICBM Vehicles simultaneously to avoid the retaliation strike."
2550 LANG "Deploy your Satellite so that its traverse path covers the centers of highlighted areas.\n\nScroll the map to alter the Satellite path or switch to the Globe View if necessary."
2549 LANG "Now build you first Satellite!"
2548 LANG "You can choose how the effort is distributed between Construction and Science. Placing more effort into one category makes another one weaker.\n\nNow unpause the game and wait until the Satellite is available."
2547 LANG "This is the Science tree. Each technology gives you new unit types or some upgrades, but takes some time to research and you rarely have enough time to discover more than one third of the tree, so choose wisely!\n\nScroll down the Science Tree and click on the Satellite technology."
2546 LANG "OK, we will have some Missiles soon, but we need to know our targets. One of the best ways to spy on the enemy is to launch a Satellite, but we need to discover this technology first.\n\nClick the New Research button."
2545 LANG "Each unit takes some time to build, so you need to plan your construction to have enough units and missiles available when you need them. However you can modify the Construction queue. Clicking on the queued unit removes it from the queue, but Shift+click moves item to the head of the queue.\n\nMove the ICBM to the head of the queue."
2544 LANG "Each Missile Silo comes with one nuclear missile (of the latest generation) already included, but we will need more, so let's build one additional missile.\n\nNote that the nuclear bombs and missiles are very expensive to build in the beginning of the game - pay attention to the Warhead production efficiency value before queueing some!\nThe efficiency constantly goes up as your technology develops and will reach 100% at approximately 2:00.00 in-game time - then you can quickly build a great stock of the nukes.\n\nNow switch to the Missiles category and add one Megaton ICBM."
2543 LANG "This screen gives you control over your Production, Research and Espionage.\n\nTo place a unit into the Construction Queue, simply click on one of the unit icons in the right part of your screen. Currently only Ground units are listed, but later you can also choose from different categories.\n\nAdd three Missile Silos to the Construction Queue."
2542 LANG "Now it is time to build some units!\n\nClick the Construction / Science / Espionage button on the control panel or press L key."
2541 LANG "Mission 6 completed.\n\nClick OK to move on to Mission 7."
2540 LANG "The ICBM has been detected by your Over-the-horizon Radar! South Asia is attacking our cities! We can do nothing about the missiles, but we can prevent more launches.\n\nUse your nuclear submarine to destroy the enemy Missile Silos.\n\nYour submarine cannot launch its missiles when under the water.\nSelect the SSBN, click the Surface button and then unpause the game for your Submarine to execute the Surface order."
2539 LANG "Attack the submarine!"
2538 LANG "There are two enemy Submarines hidden off the West Coast of America. Send your Destroyers to search for them.\n\nSearching for submarines can be tedious, as the detection range of the Sonar is quite limited and you need to cover a large area of the ocean.\n\nTo automate things, set the Move Pattern. Select the Destroyer fleet, then hold the Shift key and make several clicks in zig-zag pattern along the coast.\n\nIf you finish the Move Pattern clicking at one of the intermediate waypoints, it will become the Patrol Route and your ship will be following that until you cancel her orders."
2537 LANG "Each Nuclear Submarine carry twelve Medium Range nukes. While a Submarine stays underwater she is very difficult to find, so it can quietly approach the enemy coast and destroy the enemy infrastructure or you can run up your score by nuking the cities.\n\nSend your Submarine fleet close to the China coast."
2536 LANG "We are also going to use our own SSBN to obliterate the East Coast of China in retaliation.\n\nCreate a fleet of the Nuclear Submarine supported by the Attack Submarine and deploy it."
2535 LANG "So far we've been operating out of Europe, however this will not always be the case.\n\nIn this mission you are playing for North America and the enemy is South Asia.\n\nThe enemy has positioned a number of Nuclear Submarines off the West Coast of America. From there they will be able to nuke any target on your territory.\n\nThe best weapon against enemy submarines is the Destroyer - it can track them under water using sonar and then close in and destroy the enemy.\n\nDeploy two fleets of Destroyers off your West Coast."
2534 LANG "Mission 5 completed.\n\nClick OK to move on to Mission 6."
2533 LANG "Your fleets will engage the enemy automatically, however you can also guide them manually for more effective attack."
2532 LANG "It can take a while for your fleet to reach the destination point, so you can increase the time flow using the Time Controls.\n\nThe Time Controls are located in the bottom right corner of the screen. The game can run in real-time, x3, x6 or x20 speed - this is selected by the Speed Segments.\nAlternatively use 1,2,3,4 keys to select the game speed."
2531 LANG "The ship can leave a fleet, rejoing that fleet  or join another fleet at any time. To leave a fleet select the ship and cancel her orders. To join a fleet, give the ship the Follow order.\n\nThe keyboard shortcut for the Move order is Shift, for the Follow order - Alt, for the Attack order - Ctrl."
2530 LANG "Fleets can be controlled as a single unit. You give orders to the flagship only and the others in the same fleet will be following the flagship.\nAlternatively you can double-click on any ship of the fleet to select the whole fleet.\n\nSend your carrier groups to the highlighted zones - right-clicking gives the target-dependend order."
2529 LANG "Carriers act as mobile Airbase, allowing you to launch Attack Bombers and Fighters.\n- Destroyers are fast ships with good air defence (and later - anti-missile) abilities.\n- Cruisers are strong all-around performers that can carry tactical Nukes, but are expensive and more vulnerable to air attacks.\n\nNow build and deploy the second fleet."
2528 LANG "Your naval forces are stronger when they are grouped in fleets.\nThe fleet is centered around one flag ship with other ships following her.\n\nTo build a fleet, first click on the Carrier icon, (she will be the flag ship) then continue with adding two Destroyers and one Cruiser by clicking on them. Then deploy the fleet in your waters."
2527 LANG "Mission 4 completed.\n\nClick OK to move on to Mission 5."
2526 LANG "Now order your Airbase to attack the Missile Silo.\n\nKeep searching for the second Missile Silo and be aware of the enemy fighters!"
2525 LANG "Now you can use your bombers to attack the enemy Silo.\n\nThe underground Missile Silo is a reinforced object, so it can take quite a long time to destroy it with conventional weapons.\nLoad your bombers with the Nuclear bomb by clicking on the bomb icon below the Bomber in the Airbase control window and choosing the Nuclear Bomb config."
2524 LANG "Note that the enemy Missile Silo is well within the radar range of your aircraft, but has been detected only now. This is because some units are harder to detect - Missile Silos are camouflaged and underground, Stealth aircraft dissipate radar waves, Silent Engines of the submarines limit their visibility to sonars."
2523 LANG "Switch on the Radar Coverage mode to better understand what territory is observed by your units. \nThis can be done by clicking on the Radar Coverage button on the Control Panel in the lower right corner of the screen. Alternatively, press R button to switch the Radar Coverage on and off."
2522 LANG "Launch one of your AWACS to scout the enemy territory.\n\nYou can switch to the Launch mode either by clicking on the AWACS icon or holding the 'C' key. 'Z' corresponds to Fighters, 'X' - to Bombers.\n\nWhen you switch to the Launch mode you can see the two ranges - Safe Range and the Maximum Range.\nSafe Range shows the territory your aircraft can reach and then safely return to the home Airbase."
2521 LANG "Your Airbases can launch three types of aircraft:\nFighters : short range combat planes\nBombers : long range aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons\nAEW&C aircraft : the long range airborne radar (available with the specific technology)\n\nYou can launch any of your aircraft to scout enemy territory but AWACS make the best scouts."
2520 LANG "In many cases enemy units will be out of your Radar range or just well camouflaged (like the undeground missile silos). To survey the enemy territory you can use your air forces.\n\nPlace some Airbases in your territory."
2519 LANG "Knowing where your enemy has deployed his units is crucial for winning!\nHowever, there is no universal radar in the game:\n- Long Wave radar is good for detecting units at the long range, but does not give the precision required to fire anything but the Nuclear Weapon. And it cannot see flying nukes until it is too late!\n- Short Wave radar gives the precision to fire the conventional guided missiles, but it has the very limited range.\n- Over-the-horizon radar can be used to detect the enemy nukes from a great distance, but it cannot see anything else.\n\nMission 3 is completed.\n\nClick OK to move on to Mission 4."

Something went wrong while checking the game serial key...\n\nIf you purchased the game via Steam, this may mean Steam does not report itself to the game and is usually associated with the lack of user rights when running Steam, or with Steam installed in the non-standard path.\n\nTry the following guide to fix the problem:\n\nStep 1: Run the game as Administrator\n\n- Right-click the game in your Steam Library.\n- Go to Properties, then to the Local Files tab.\n- Click Browse Local Files.\n- Locate the game executable (the application file).\n- Right-click it and go to Properties.\n- Click the Compatibility tab.\n- Check the 'Run this program as an administrator' box.\n- Click Apply. Having done this, restart Steam and try launching the game again.\n\n\nStep 2: Run Steam as Administrator\n\n- Navigate your Steam installation file (By default, it is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam).\n- Right-click the Steam executable.\n- Follow the above steps to set it to Run as Administrator.\n- Restart Steam.\n\n\nStep 3: Verify Integrity of Game Cache\n\n- Now that Steam is running as Admin, it should have no permission issues.\n\n- Go to your Steam LIBRARY, right-click ICBM: Escalation, select Properties, open the Local Files tab and select VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME CACHE"
